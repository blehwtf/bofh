Sadly, the managers have found out about his poorly planned foray into network design and installation. They are NOT pleased. How they got wind of it is anybody's guess, but I did notice that the pimply-faced-youth has completely finished the 'to do' list I left him last night. His attention to detail is commendable.</p><p>Fitting substandard cable wouldn't have gone so badly for the boss but for his choice of installation technique. Although it may have been adversely affected by a friendly discussion with the PFY and myself over a couple of lagers.</p><p>Boss: &quot;So I'm looking at multi-pair plug looms running along the bottom of raised floor offices, and terminated at the three outlet points I've allocated per room ...&quot;</p><p>Me: &quot;Plug looms? Not like the ones we used in the offices downstairs a couple of years ago? One nudge and the connectors went open circuit.&quot;</p><p>Boss: &quot;But then I thought that single runs of Cat 5 direct from the comms cupboard would be a better option.&quot;</p><p>PFY: &quot;Along the floor? So when someone spills their coffee it'll trickle through onto the cable, shorting out th...&quot;</p><p>Boss (quickly): &quot;Did I say along the floor? I meant inside the wall cavities ...&quot;</p><p>I'm sure you can imagine the rest - like shooting a fish in a barrel.</p><p>Still, the three useless wall outlets make interesting conversation pieces. But I could even have forgiven the boss for that, had he not tried for a save by installing some expensive wireless LAN equipment in the outer offices, in the mistaken belief that infra-red was some form of short distance radio transmission medium. (I have absolutely no idea where he got that idea from, although the PFY's nose does look a little longer in recent days). From this, the boss has discovered the negative career potential of installing networking that only works when your office door is open ...</p><p>&quot;We've really got a problem here,&quot; he chirps in a hunted manner as he paces my office.</p><p>&quot;What's that?&quot; I ask helpfully.</p><p>&quot;The bloody network, it's a shambles!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well I don't mean to rub salt into your wounds, but you probably should've let us do the planning. After all, that's what we're paid for.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And what would you have done that was so different?&quot; he demands offensively.</p><p>&quot;Hmm...&quot; the PFY cuts in, &quot;I would have run some multi-pair plug looms of real Cat 5 (and not some cheap imitation) under the raised floors, and terminated them at the three outlet points that I'd have allocated per room.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But that's what I proposed!&quot; he blurts, realisation hitting him.</p><p>&quot;Well actions do speak louder than words,&quot; I sigh. &quot;Speaking of which, I believe there's a legal one heading your way real soon.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What am I going to do,&quot; he wails in a voice very reminiscent of a user at disk defragmentation time.</p><p>&quot;Well you could have the cabling replaced,&quot; I reply.</p><p>&quot;Yes, you're right, I'll do that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Only its cable-tied every six inches inside a wall, and that means they'll have to partially demolish it to ...&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's no good!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well then there's only plan B left.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What is it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You pay a one-time subscription to 'Bastard-Net Inc' and agree to large overtime bills. The problem will be gone by tomorrow and just a memory by next Wednesday.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What's the subscription and where do I pay?&quot; he blurts.</p><p>&quot;Two hundred quid; the PFY and me.&quot;</p><p>Seeing the rock and hard place at close proximity once more, the boss reaches for his wallet.</p><p>The next day, security are combing the building for the eight office doors mysteriously stolen during the night. Strangely, the CCTV noted nothing but a rerun of The Beverley Hillbillies.</p><p>Network stability in the new offices is at an all-time high, except for when the head of PR (a heavily built gentleman who looks like he was poured into his clothes and forgot to say when) passes by. His popularity around those offices appears to be waning fast.</p><p>One week later, the sub-floor recable is completed and the PFY and I present our overtime sheets for approval.</p><p>&quot;Hang on,&quot; the boss shouts. &quot;168 hours? That's 24 hours a day for seven days!&quot;</p><p>&quot;We did work extremely hard,&quot; the PFY chips in.</p><p>&quot;You can't seriously expect me to sign this,&quot; the boss says, ever so slightly annoyed.</p><p>&quot;Of course not,&quot; I reply. &quot;We'll just put the network back the way it was then. Oh, and I wonder ...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wonder what?!&quot; the boss snarls.</p><p>&quot;Whose fingerprints were on that pile of stolen doors that security found ...&quot;</p><p>&quot;When?!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Tomorrow morning ...&quot;</p><p>One autograph later, the PFY and I take the rest of the day off to recuperate from our stressful overtime.</p><hr noshade><p align=center>Previous : <a href="bofh23oct.html">The B.O.F.H. bides his time to unravel a mess ...</a><br>Next : <a href="bofh6nov.html">Infiltration of the e-mail system ...</a></p><p align=center>Back to <a href="../index.html#New">The Bastard Menu</a>.</p></font></BODY></HTML>
