I grab the laptop with the UPS diagnostics on it and follow him.</p><p>Having no real need for the laptop I slip it onto the floor as soon as I'm inside and &quot;stress test&quot; any listening devices that may have been &quot;accidentally&quot; left there by the boss by inserting my pen into the cooling fan at the rear of the UPS</p><p>&quot;What's the problem?&quot; I ask, shouting over the noise of a plastic ballpoint being buzzed away by the heftiest cooling fins in the room.</p><p>&quot;The boss has found out about the help line&quot; he shouts, looking around warily, expecting capture and torture at any moment.</p><p>Oh dear. A great little money spinner that too. A reasonably simple idea in theory - automatically divert every newly disconnected phone in the company to an 0898 number which gives you sound computing advice.</p><p>Advice like &quot;Your problem sounds like inadequate air cooling. The only possible solution is to water cool your computer. Go to the water fountain...&quot; etc. Amazing how many calls a person receives once they leave - at 99p a minute - and yet more amazing how many phones don't have forwarding toll-bars.</p><p>As quickly as possible I ring the 0898 people and reluctantly shout to them that we wish to discontinue the service, then get the cheque sent on to my accountant under my little-known pseudonym of &quot;Deceased&quot;. (no first or middle initials - Great for tax purposes). The figure they mention cheers the PFY and me up though. Obviously more calls than I'd imagined.</p><p>&quot;How did they find out?&quot; I ask</p><p>&quot;I think I might have keyed in a typo the last disconnect and got a live one instead&quot; the PFY confesses, with a due amount of trepidation.</p><p>Forgiveness being the key in times of crisis, I figure we bide our time looking like we're fixing the UPS until the Boss can't take it any more.</p><p>Minutes later the boss bursts in full tilt to collect what his listening device can't and collects my laptop with his shoe instead. His tardy reflexes divert his shoe mid-stomp so that he catches the side of it, flipping open its cover and sending him hurtling face first into a comms rack.</p><p>Nasty.</p><p>&quot;Oooh&quot; the PFY mutters, &quot;I bet that hurt&quot;.</p><p>The look on the boss's face as he roughly extricates himself from the dangling cables confirms this guess..</p><p>&quot;What the hell are you doing in here?&quot; he snarls, dabbing at his grazed facials with his handkerchief</p><p>&quot;Just checking out this noisy fan. It looks serious&quot;, I say, giving it a hefty jab out of his sight for old times sake.</p><p>Did I say old time's sake? I meant last time's sake. The fan, having had enough of the extra load of my pen, stops completely, emitting nothing but a tiny &gt;click&lt; and shuddering to a halt.</p><p>&quot;BLOODY HELL!&quot; the boss shouts over the UPS alarm, which is no mean feat considering it's made to be heard through the sound-proofed wall.</p><p>&quot;SWITCH IT OVER T...o the other unit&quot; he finishes as I press the Alarm Silence button</p><p>&quot;There's not much chance of that&quot;, the PFY calls, bringing over the shredded remains of the laptop, the condition of which would seem to have got a lot worse in the last few seconds.</p><p>&quot;Sorry about that&quot;, he says, &quot;but someone left a cable laying on the ground ...&quot;</p><p>We turn to the boss.</p><p>&quot; ...which I tripped over.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well it's too late for that - get another one!&quot; the boss shouts, self-preservation at the management meeting key in his mind.</p><p>&quot;We can't&quot;, I chip in. &quot;The backup's got a dead hard-drive that you wouldn't let us replace&quot;, I add, applying a recent situation to my advantage.</p><p>&quot;Whew!&quot; The PFY mutters, &quot;wouldn't want to be in your shoes. It won't look at all good that - your budget being the cause a site outage ...&quot;</p><p>&quot;A SITE OUTAGE!?!&quot; the boss gasps.</p><p>&quot;Well, you did say that all faulty UPS units in the comms cupboards should replaced with a feed from the central UPS to cut costs ...&quot;, I add</p><p>The boss gets that hunted look.</p><p>&quot;All right, what do you want?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I think you already know that&quot;, I smile, benevolently. Or is that malevolently, I always get those two mixed up.</p><p>Ten minutes later I have the printed copies of his telephone enquiry as well as the photocopies he hid in the safe just in case.</p><p>I pop back to the UPS as it's nearing its temperature cut-out point and demonstrate how simple it is to manually reset a fan circuit breaker ...</p><p>It's funny how things work out for the best, isn't it?</p><hr noshade><p align=center>Previous : <a href="bofh19jun.html">The BOFH plays safe ...</a><br>Next : <a href="bofh3jul.html">The BOFH has heated exchange with the boss ...</a></p><p align=center>Back to <a href="../index.html#New">The Bastard Menu</a>.</p></font></BODY></HTML>
