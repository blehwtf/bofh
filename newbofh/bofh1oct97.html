Enter George, some lager, a shredder and several PFYs to-be ...</strong></em></font></p><hr noshade><p>I'm feeling a little seedy this morning after I put several hours (and lagers) into finding out just what the hell's going on.</p><p>It appears that George from Cleaning and Maintenance has overheard some startling conversations between the head of IT and the boss. They are plotting on winning the CEO's favour with the result of getting shot of the PFY and I.</p><p>A small amount of dosh later, George tells us how they intend to accomplish their aim...</p><p>So it comes as no surprise when the CEO and IT brown-nose crew (the boss and head of IT) enter the office.</p><p>&quot;I'd like to ask you a little favour if I may,&quot; the CEO begins benevolently.</p><p>&quot;What can I do for you?&quot; I ask, getting a little naso-trouser action in myself.</p><p>&quot;Well, it's my grandchild's computer applications class,&quot; he says.</p><p>&quot;Surely you're too young to have grandchildren?&quot; the head of IT blurts.</p><p>The CEO continues: &quot;Well, apparently they'd like to see some of the theory in action and I thought...&quot;</p><p>&quot;...that we could show them how a real computer centre works,&quot; the PFY finishes.</p><p>&quot;Exactly.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No sooner said than done,&quot; I say, taking the lead in the brown-nose hurdles.</p><p>&quot;And I'll sort out some souvenirs, lunch and transport,&quot; the PFY adds, winning by a length, closely followed by me, and the boss.</p><p>Two days later the group of Slightly-Pimply-Faced-Youths shows up at IT Central. Half the department is on the alert as word's got around there's some form of benefit to be had from this sort of activity.</p><p>&quot;Before we start, I'd just like to quickly cover the topic of safety in this building.&quot;</p><p>The CEO smiles gratefully, knowing I have the best interests of his kin and class at heart.</p><p>Five minutes later our attentive students are preparing themselves to enter the Comms room when a loud shriek is heard from outside Mission Control.</p><p>&quot;And lastly,&quot; I say, removing the cable between the step-up transformer and the door handle, &quot;a sincere thanks to our boss for his practical demonstration of the dangers of electricity.&quot; I open the door to reveal the boss, with a more vacant expression than usual, sitting on the floor outside the office with a pile of IT ID-cards scattered about him. &quot;You can never be too careful.&quot;</p><p>The boss is ferried away to sick bay for a quick once-over (and a change of undergarments if my nose does not deceive me) while the head of IT spots an opportunity to join the class as we take them through to the Comms room. He gazes on in awe as we identify the various bits and pieces therein (half of which he signed for) and ask for questions as we wander into the tape and document safe.</p><p>&quot;What are they for?&quot; the CEO's descendant asks pointing at some of our equipment.</p><p>&quot;Those are for document destruction. This is a bulk eraser and that's a shredder. Would you like to try?&quot;</p><p>A couple of students are keen to try their hand at it so we give them some old tapes and a stack of paper and leave them to it.</p><p>&quot;What's that TV set for?&quot; asks one of the students, pointing at a 29in monitor.</p><p>&quot;That's not a TV set,&quot; the head chuckles. &quot;That's a security camera monitor.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But it's got a stereo video attached to it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;A security recorder with dual audio channels, isn't it?&quot; the head asks me.</p><p>&quot;Well, it looks like a TV and video to me. I still don't know why you ordered it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ordered it?&quot; the PFY pipes up. &quot;He asked me to get stores to deliver it to his home.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You requested it.&quot; The head is losing his calm.</p><p>&quot;What on earth for? Anyway, I keep copies of all requests. Until they've been filled, at which time they get shredded...&quot;</p><p>The head, in Superman mode, attempts to leap a high tape stack in a single bound, faceplanting the shredding machine. A nasty sight for the young and impressionable, but not as nasty as what follows when his tie slips into the shredder blades... The PFY switches it off at the wall saving the boss further injury, but also disabling the reverse switch.</p><p>&quot;Once again we see the dangers of our workplace,&quot; I lecture as the boss thrashes around trying to free himself. &quot;Even a shredder can be dangerous. Even this bulk eraser could cause problems especially if you weren't wearing an anti-magnetic watch like our head here.&quot;</p><p>BZZZZZZZZZERT...</p><p>&quot;Oh. Or if you were wearing one that said it was anti-magnetic, but wasn't, like the boss here. Thank you very much for demonstrating sir.&quot; The CEO smiles, happy in the knowledge that the class has learned something. Situation restored to normal.</p><hr noshade><p align=center>Previous : <a href="bofh24sep97.html">The boss tries to out-bastard the Bastard ...</a><br>Next : <a href="bofh8oct97.html">The PFY shows compassion to a user ...</a></p><p align=center>Back to <a href="../index.html#New97">The Bastard Menu</a>.</p></font></BODY></HTML>
