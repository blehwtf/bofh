My only worry being that if I called up a good agency, I'd probably get a job - which rather defeats the purpose of the exercise. My purpose is to make the boss wince every time there's a contracting rate review. And to rake in more dosh of course.</p><p>Bearing in mind my job prospects, I put some feelers out with a couple of the large but mostly dodgy agencies. The sort of agency that will 'smooth out the wrinkles' in your CV before faxing them on to a prospective employer.</p><p>Wrinkles like, 'I done DOS once,' and 'I know how to turn my screen on,' become 'Wrote DOS from scratch,' and 'Extensive Hardware Support Background'.</p><p>I expect the worst and get it. I meet my placement consultant at a local pub, where he buys me a beer to prove that he's really my friend, and not someone who wants a criminal percentage of my wages.</p><p>&quot;So,&quot; my personally assigned, widely experienced, computing professional placement consultant says: &quot;You're looking for a position in networking?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What sort of experience do you have?&quot;</p><p>I run through a quick synopsis of the past 10 years.</p><p>&quot;Excellent. Now, have you had much experience of DOS?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well we have an excellent position in DOS consultancy at the moment.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And you feel that's a networking position?&quot; I ask, already annoyed.</p><p>&quot;Well, not exactly. Initially it would be more of a help desk role.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not interested. I'm networks, not systems, and definitely not support.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ah. Oh well, it was a thought. What about VAX/VMS?&quot;</p><p>&quot;DECNet? TCP/IP? Dare I say it, CI?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, more in the lines of Cobol Programming. Great position there. In Milton Ke..&quot;</p><p>&quot;No.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Very good pay...&quot;</p><p>&quot;If I'd wanted to do Cobol Programming I would have said so. But I didn't, I said 'networking'.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course, so you did. hardware engineering doesn't interest you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;What sort of hardware?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Dead terminals mainly. But when they're working they're connected to a terminal server, which is on a network...&quot; he calls out as I leave the pub, drink only half finished.</p><p>The boss meanwhile has been playing my game and has faxed out to a couple of contracting agencies himself, obviously in an effort to show me how cheaply he can get a replacement. It's sad how people delude themselves sometimes.</p><p>My next few days are punctuated by offers of data entry, fill-in secretarial work, tape monkeying etc. Which I decline. At long last one of the agencies comes through with a price that would bring tears to the boss's eyes. I get the details and am thinking about it when the boss walks in.</p><p>&quot;I'll take it,&quot; I say, as the boss discreetly tunes into my conversation.</p><p>&quot;Take what?&quot; he asks.</p><p>&quot;The job I was just offered,&quot; I reply, smiling cheesily.</p><p>He rallies under the pressure and responds: &quot;And just in time too!&quot;</p><p>&quot;For what, Christmas shopping?&quot; I say, applying pressure.</p><p>&quot;No. Just in time for us. I've found your replacement!&quot; he gloats, shaking a wad of barely readable faxed paper.</p><p>&quot;You're not serious!&quot; I say, pointing at the paper, &quot;you can't even read it!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don't need to,&quot; he smirks, &quot;I rang them and verified the details.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You're not going to trust THAT agency are you?&quot; I cry. &quot;They can't even place an advert properly, let alone a computing professional.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's where you're wrong!&quot; the boss snarls. &quot;They HAVE found me someone. Far more experienced than you, and only a fraction more expensive. And he starts this afternoon. SECURITY!&quot;</p><p>The moment the boss has been dreaming of for months has arrived.</p><p>&quot;Escort this member of the public to the street. Don't let him touch anything, and take his access keys off him at the door. He's to speak to no-one. And have him removed from the contractors' register IMMEDIATELY! Have his personal effects checked for items of the company's, then forward them on to him.&quot;</p><p>Job done, he swaggers back to his office, the John Wayne of networks and systems.</p><p>I am escorted to the street and hand over my access keys. I take a quick survey of the building that was once my workplace, then wander back in to reception.</p><p>&gt;Ding!&lt; &quot;Hello,&quot; I smile to the receptionist. &quot;I've just been appointed to a position as Network Administrator. Could you ring my supervisor please...&quot;</p><p>Can't wait to see John Wayne's face. Or my new pay cheque. Or the memo saying that as a new entry on the contractors' register I am required to attend a paid week's-worth of safety lectures.</p><hr noshade><p align=center>Previous : <a href="bofh5jun.html">The BOFH wins the day in France ...</a><br>Next : <a href="bofh19jun.html">The BOFH plays safe ...</a></p><p align=center>Back to <a href="../index.html#New">The Bastard Menu</a>.</p></font></BODY></HTML>
