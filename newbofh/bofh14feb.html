He got my name from one of those magazine 'free subscription' forms a couple of months ago, which contains information inaccurate by a factor of 10, (except the 'Spending Authority' which I inflated by a factor of 100). A little white lie never hurt anyone and periodically dispels the rumour that there's no such thing as a free lunch.</p><p>I mentally switch to junket-mode, and tell him it's the technical manager he wants to speak to and can he hold. Two seconds later he's talking to my party-stopping imitation of one of our better-known technical managers.</p><p>&quot;I'd like to come and meet with you to discuss a future-proofed network solution, if that's at all possible&quot;, he gushes.</p><p>The last thing I want him to do is come to the office and ask around for &quot;the technical manager&quot;, so I go for the quick junket.</p><p>&quot;Well,&quot; I say, &quot;I'm a little tied up with some equipment reviews this week&quot;.</p><p>He's pausing a little too long for my liking. This probably means he isn't fully committed to crowbarring open the expense account.</p><p>I turn up the heat a little.</p><p>&quot;Then I've a budgeting meeting next week to earmark spending in the next quarter, so I'll be busy preparing for that as well&quot;.</p><p>He smells dosh and goes for it.</p><p>&quot;Tell you what - how about meeting for lunch - you've got to eat, right? No obligation, I'll just outline our products and I'm sure you'll see the advantages for yourself&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Well ...&quot;, I stall.</p><p>&quot;Luigi's, 12 on Thursday?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I, ah ...&quot;, I burble, playing hard-to-bribe.</p><p>&quot;OK, I'll make the reservations&quot;, he closes, like a true sales champ.</p><p>I get into our electronic meeting planner with the manager's password (his wife's name - I mean, if they're not going to try to be secure ...) and make the entry for Luigi's. I make sure to select 'Hide Appts' option, as three can be a crowd.</p><p>Thursday rolls around and I show up at the bar at 11.30am and work my way through 'imported spirits' while the tab's open. By the time the sales guy gets there, I am, as we in the Ethernet trade say, in a promiscuous mode. I will buy anything. Or at least I would if I had any money. Which I don't. However, I do have several of the manager's business cards and a fairly acceptable version of his signature down pat.</p><p>The next three hours whirl by as I look through several catalogues of shiny, beta-tested, 'top-of-the-line' hardware, drooling as only a technical manager can, and dropping comments like: &quot;nice lights&quot;. By about 3pm I feel it's time for the stress period, so I tell him that there is no networking budget for the year as I spent it all in advance last year.</p><p>He starts crying in an attempt to make me feel guilty. I pretend to fold and tell him to order me a truckload of goods which I'll fake as last year's order.</p><p>&quot;Will it work?&quot;, he sniffs.</p><p>&quot;Of course ...&quot;, I say. &quot;Now, you go and clean up, you're a little bit of a mess&quot;.</p><p>He exits for the bathroom, and I quickly check his wallet. There's about &#163;70, so I remove about &#163;40 of it - I don't want to leave him totally broke. While I'm at it, I remove his last payment method by jiggling my trusty permanent magnet around the magstripe on his credit cards, then make my way to the bar to order another drink.</p><p>I talk to the barman till the sales guy returns to the table.</p><p>&quot;Well&quot;, I say. &quot;I have to get back to the office&quot;.</p><p>He eyes me suspiciously.</p><p>&quot;Tell you what&quot;, I say. &quot;How about I sign an order form and you can fill it in back at your office?&quot;</p><p>A salesman's dream.</p><p>Just time to whizz through the manager's signature, pocket the dosh and I'm halfway back to work as the police roar by on their way to Luigi's.</p><p>Obviously their treatment of defaulting clients hasn't changed recently. With any luck, it'll just be the one kneecap - unless, of course, the chef's throwing arm is back in ...</p><hr noshade><p align=center>Previous : <a href="bofh7feb.html">The BOFH, the user and the printer ...</a><br>Next : <a href="bofh21feb.html">The BOFH, the boss and the bribe ...</a></p><p align=center>Back to <a href="../index.html#New">The Bastard Menu</a>.</p></font></BODY></HTML>
