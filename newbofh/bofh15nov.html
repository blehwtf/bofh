You're thinking, is he monitoring the fourth floor or the fifth? Well, to tell you the truth, in all the excitement, I haven't looked at the screen myself. But, taking into account I have a defined key to invoke a kernel debugger on the server which can erase even the MEMORY of your database process - and the work you've done this morning - I'd like you to ask yourself one question: do I feel lucky? ... Well, do ya? ... Punk! ?&quot; I demand.</p><p>I hear the clatter of the receiver on the wall, and in my mind's eye I can almost see the frightened accounts clerk scurrying back to the office to close the connection to the database in an orderly fashion before failover time.</p><p>My mind's eye being not what it once was, I flip through my CCTV monitors of the fourth floor until I see a geeky guy, laden with lunch, beating a hasty path to his office.</p><p>I click on the security window and deactivate the 'Door Open' knobs on the stairwell.</p><p>I almost wish I'd turned the CCTV sound on so I could hear the thud when the door didn't open, but you can't have everything.</p><p>Rule 75 of Network Ops: never log a fault on a device from the lunchroom. Especially if your office is up a flight of stairs and on the other side of the building.</p><p>I get on with my work, which today is 'fixing' the swipecard door-access machine. Apparently there's some logic glitch that no-one knew about until a particularly annoying sales consultant got accidentally locked in the secure area over the holiday weekend. The poor guy was a drooling wreck when they found him - apparently the sirens and sprinklers were playing up in there too, every 10 minutes.</p><p>It all goes to show that you can't be too careful when you don't hold the lift open for someone laden with networking magazines ...</p><p>I upload the original swipecard microcode over my specialised patched version, and give the system a clean bill of health. It was obviously a freak hardware problem, and nothing to do with the network whatsoever ...</p><p>While I'm in the computer room, a hard drive arrives in preparation for a disk replacement, which means the engineer can't be far away.</p><p>Quick as a flash I have the box open, wind a couple of paper clips round the power terminals at the back of the drive and return it to its packaging.</p><p>Scant seconds later a pin-striped service engineer arrives.</p><p>&quot;Hi, I've come to replace the faulty drive,&quot; he buzzes.</p><p>I lead him over to the machine with the Fault Status on it and he goes to work.</p><p>&quot;Will you be wanting me to have the system shut down?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&quot;Oh no, didn't you know, this machine is mirrored and hot-swapable. I just pull the cover off like this.&quot;</p><p>Clip!</p><p>&quot;Loosen these two retaining screws, grab the new disk and ... ... Hey, did you open this bag?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, it must have been sent like that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh. It was probably the office when they pre-formatted it.&quot;</p><p>He has now added 'lying to the client' to his list of sins. Tragic.</p><p>He continues: &quot;I get the new drive in one hand, slide out the old drive like so ... place it on the ground like so ...&quot;</p><p>Clunk!</p><p>&quot;And slide in the new one like so ... and ...&quot;</p><p><strong>BANG!</strong></p><p>The smell of ozone tells me that both the paper clips and the power supply are no more. Time to play dirty.</p><p>&quot;What the hell happened?!&quot; I demand.</p><p>&quot;Er, it appears that the replacement drive was slightly faulty, and the extra load may have overworked your power supply.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You blew up our machine!&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, no, it's only a power supply problem. All I need to do is slide the disk out like so, switch the power off and flick this switch to change over the power supplies. Now I switch her on, and ...&quot;</p><p>Nothing happens.</p><p>&quot;Nothing's happened!&quot;</p><p>He hits me with the old engineer special: &quot;That's interesting!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, that's what yesterday's engineer said when he blew the other power supply.&quot;</p><p>A network loading alarm shakes me awake in front of my terminal and I realise that it had all been a pleasant dream. Ah well, I guess a network engineer's got to know his limitations.</p><p>The phone rings, I pick it up.</p><p>&quot;I know what you're thinking ...&quot;</p><hr noshade><p align=center>Previous : <a href="bofh8nov.html">The BOFH and the 'C' word ...</a><br>Next : <a href="bofh22nov.html">The BOFH seeks sweet revenge ...</a></p><p align=center>Back to <a href="../index.html#New">The Bastard Menu</a>.</p></font></BODY></HTML>
