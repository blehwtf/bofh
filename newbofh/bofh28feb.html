Could you wind your stereo down a couple of decibels - I'm trying to get some work done and it's difficult to concentrate.&quot;</p><p>Without thinking, I reach for my soldering iron and flick it to 'paint-strip'. I pause mid-'scorched earth policy' and reconsider. He's new, he deserves a chance.</p><p>&quot;Sorry&quot;, I say, seeing what it feels like, while turning the volume from 11 to 2.</p><p>He wanders off happily to the astonishment of the others in the department who have already rung personnel to advise them of the vacancy.</p><p>The Boss pops in to make sure that I'm really in the office and has a look around. As he exits I notice a hint of a smile on his face.</p><p>Five minutes later he's back asking me to help him install the back-up program on his laptop. For some reason, instead of copying the DELETE.EXE file to BACKUP.EXE I actually load the backup software ...</p><p>Something's wrong, I'm sure of it now. I call my fiend-like pimply-faced young assistant over and ask him how he is.</p><p>He tells me that today he's solved a couple of users' problems and helped repatch an accountant's machine after a move.</p><p>Now I'm worried. Something's definitely wrong! He used the 'a' word (rather than bean-counter).</p><p>The next day dawns and I start out with a couple of random telephone repatches, but my heart's not in it. By mid-afternoon I've patched them back and apologised for the inconvenience. The boss is still smiling.</p><p>I've been careful and not eaten anything, so it's something else. Something insidious. After a long battle with my conscience, I look into the recent purchases authorised by the boss, telling myself I'm doing it to check that all the orders total-up properly.</p><p>I find what I think I'm looking for in the form of 10 'ultra-positive' ionisers recently installed into the air conditioning system. I can't yet bring myself to do anything about it, so I stand in the printer room, air-conditioning off and laser printers full-on. Half an hour later I'm almost normal. I break for home to make my plans.</p><p>Next morning I rise early and slip into work unnoticed in half-scuba paraphernalia.</p><p>First stop, the air conditioning tower on the roof. I locate the offending units and reprogram them repeatedly with a claw hammer.</p><p>Next stop, the CEO's office with a similar ioniser of my own design. I hide it away then wander down to the telephone operator's room, divert her line directly to the CEO, then lock-out her console.</p><p>Down in the comms room I fashion a trip-wire out of the power cables to the main database applications and network servers. Back in my office, windows open, I await the start of work. Nothing happens till 9:45 when the CEO, after 15 minutes of phone calls and exposure to my positive ion generator, calls the boss. I watch and call him immediately the boss hangs up.</p><p>&quot;THIS IS NOT THE OPERATOR!&quot; he shouts.</p><p>&quot;Yes sir, I know that&quot;, I say, all kindness and understanding. &quot;I just noticed that your phone seems to be receiving all the calls for the telephone operator and her console appears to be locked. She's been acting a bit strangely the last couple of days - well, as a matter of fact we all have I suppose. Now I'll pop into the comms ...&quot;</p><p>The boss, in panic mode, sweeps through my room and rams the comms door open, ripping the power cables from the servers.</p><p>I flip a quick cheesy grin at the boss as he looks in horror at what he's just done.</p><p>&quot;Home Team ONE, Your Future Job Prospects, NIL&quot;, I call out with my finger on the mute button. &quot;Oh dear&quot;, I utter into the unmuted phone. &quot;The boss has just had a little accident ...&quot;</p><hr noshade><p align=center>Previous : <a href="bofh21feb.html">The BOFH, the boss and the bribe ...</a><br>Next : <a href="bofh6mar.html">The BOFH and the cruise control ...</a></p><p align=center>Back to <a href="../index.html#New">The Bastard Menu</a>.</p></font></BODY></HTML>
