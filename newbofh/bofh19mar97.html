Amazing as it seems, but thanks to odd goings on at the masons, he's managed to arrange a co-operative site visit scheme with a few local companies to foster a frank exchange of networking information and expertise.</p><p>Like hell.</p><p>We know it's a ploy to get us out of the building so he can search high and low for the three blank, yet countersigned, order forms we extorted out of him under threat of showing the CEO what the boardroom table and a member secretarial staff have been up to in his presence lately. Who'd have thought that adding a low-light camera to the conference recording system would pay off so quickly?</p><p>As for the site visits, a skilled bastard recognises IMMEDIATELY a chance to upgrade equipment when it presents itself. The PFY and I set to work slipping the sadly unused false bottoms back into our briefcases, then load them up with outmoded networking kit.</p><p>According to plan, by the time the Network Manager on our first site has finished showing me the full beauty of their patching racks the PFY has hot-swapped half a dozen 10/100 5 port Ethernet cards for our old straight 10s. Like taking candy from a baby. And leaving it the wrapper ...</p><p>The second site is much more secure and proves to be a slight challenge, right up until lunchtime when we roll on down to the local for seven or eight pints of the hard stuff, with Tequila slammers to follow. A pittance to pay for the latest revision router EPROMS that our support company wanted a small fortune for whilst their erstwhile network manager snores his way through the afternoon.</p><p>Being a kind-hearted sod, I'll make sure to drop them back in the mail as a &quot;bug-fix upgrade&quot; after only making a slight change to the switching logic.</p><p>I feel sure that the competitive advantage will lean in our favour once the &quot;Use Heaviest Loaded Segment&quot; code cuts in ...</p><p>We're only interrupted once when their PFY (so green he needs mowing) wanders in to see what we're doing. A quick flash of my tube pass and he thinks he's witnessing a vendor-initiated hardware service check in operation. It truly breaks my heart to see trust like that go unpunished.</p><p>The effects of the lunch are a little too filling for my PFY's limited experience in the alcoholic arts so he enquires the location of the nearest Gents from his counterpart whilst I snaffle the Computer Room cardkey so carelessly left laying around in his pocket ...</p><p>Seconds later the power goes out, which can only mean the PFY's rest stop included a visit to the cabling cupboard. Darkness, the true friend of bastards everywhere is interrupted only by a couple of EXIT signs which flicker briefly, then go out. Now that's what I call a good trainee.</p><p>Quicker than you can say &quot;High Capacity Storage Downgrade&quot; I'm performing an impromptu one in the Computer Room whilst adding a significant weight to my briefcase at the same time. I get out in time to see hear their PFY trip over a cabling drum I'd accidentally nudged out into the centre of the room on my way into the Computer Room.</p><p>The lights come on in time to see the PFY helping their PFY into a chair. The poor bloke seems a little woozy so I try to help out by taking a few of the phone calls that are inundating the room.</p><p>&quot;THE BLOODY NETWORK IS DOWN!&quot; A user screams at me in a manner that would have personnel immediately calculating sick-pay entitlement at our site, but seems par for the course here.</p><p>&quot;Yes, it's due to the power cut from the surge-current overloading.&quot; I ad-lib &quot;You should switch your machines to low-power mode to prevent it&quot;</p><p>&quot;How do I do that?&quot; The user asks, bringing back my thoughts of trust and punishment.</p><p>&quot;Switch all the machines in your office off, switch them to low power with the switch at the back, then turn them all on at the same time.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Is 115 the low-power setting?&quot; the user asks.</p><p>&quot;You betcha!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Thanks&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don't mention it!&quot; I cry as the PFY and I make a break for the door.</p><p>Our exit is heralded by a storm of sharp crack! noises from the ground-floor offices, which brings a small song of joy to my heart ...</p><p>The last site on our visit is a surprise. We're apparently visiting the offices of our chief opposition, those who tried to take us over.</p><p>Looks like tuna casserole on the menu ...</p><p>My suspicions are confirmed when I notice the presence of several sub-miniature camera holes lining the corridors of the entrance, all but invisible to the layperson, raising the stakes somewhat ...</p><p>Then again, I love a challenge ...</p><hr noshade><p align=center>Previous : <a href="bofh12mar97.html">The B.O.F.H. is labelled Politically Unsound ...</a><br>Next : <a href="bofh26mar97.html">The B.O.F.H. and PFY help sort out a rival's PSIC problems ...</a></p><p align=center>Back to <a href="../index.html#New97">The Bastard Menu</a>.</p></font></BODY></HTML>
