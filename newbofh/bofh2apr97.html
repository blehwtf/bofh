Mind you, I don't trust those foreign wines - After Chernobyl you never know if they're going to be radioactive ...&quot;</p><p>The boss looks at me as if I've been mentally demoted to the using classes, but the PFY knows the big plan and keeps quiet.</p><p>&quot;How DID you manage to convince them?&quot; I ask appealing to the boss' s need to gloat.</p><p>&quot;Oh, just told them that it was one of the original units and still as good at the day we bought it,&quot; he sniggers, mentally convincing himself that he's the brains of the outfit ...</p><p>And that's one thought that I'm not going to challenge because today is April 1st - Bastard Boss Day - and I have my eyes on a certain prize that has eluded me for many years.</p><p>This year I've decided to sell the boss on using the network as a storage medium. I casually drop a couple of remarks until the boss decides to channel his massive intelligence away from tying his shoelaces and onto the matter at hand.</p><p>&quot;It's simplicity itself!&quot; I cry &quot;We've got these Gigabit Ethernet switches all around the place that we just aren't using! Instead of letting them go to waste we could be sending data continuously around them until it's needed which would actually cut down on the amount of physical disk storage we would need! And just think of the time we would save with read and write latency when the data's already on the net!&quot;</p><p>&quot;It would never work,&quot; the PFY counters, all according to plan. &quot;Our networks are too short - the data would be back before it had finished leaving the machine.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not,&quot; I add, &quot;if we were to make the network longer to add a short delay. Why, 10 drums of Cat-5 wired together would be sufficient&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Hey!&quot; the PFY smiles. &quot;That's right - I never thought of that.&quot;</p><p>Our interplay has been enough to sell the Boss. Had I put forward the idea and the PFY agreed, the Boss would have trodden with caution, fearing the worst. With the PFY &quot;on his side&quot; he now knows that the idea is a sure thing.</p><p>Like lambs to the slaughter ...</p><p>&quot;Excellent, I'm sure that the head of department will approve!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Would you be sure to mention that I thought of it?&quot; I ask, placing the last two nails in the Boss's coffin. Now he's sure that it's the real thing and there is no way on earth he's going to let me take credit for it.</p><p>He toddles off to the Head of Dept while the PFY and I try to stroll nonchalantly back to the office. I fire up the CCTV recorder on the microcamera in the Big Boss's office.</p><p>This little recording is sure to earn me the Trophy I have desired for so long - the coveted &quot;IT Idiot&quot; Award for Least Intelligent Supervisor - at the Bastard Boss Competitions at a Central London pub later on tonight ...</p><p>We get the recorder going just in time ...</p><p>&quot;Anyway... &quot; the boss burbles in simulated intelligence mode, &quot;I was just wandering through the department today and a thought struck me. What with the rising cost of disk it might be an interesting plan to use our networks as a storage medium ...&quot;</p><p>He goes on to paraphase the food-waste-product that we fed him, while commenting that he's fired off an order for 20 drums of Cat-5.</p><p>The explosion is inevitable. The head of department, whilst in practical terms about as useful as loopback plug for an electric type-writer, did spend about six years teaching networking fundamentals to first year university students.</p><p>The PFY and I capture everything in case there's some question of 'doping' ...</p><p>Later that night as I guzzle a pint or two from my latest acquisition, I can't help but feel a twinge of remorse. Maybe I should have convinced him to use lift cables as emergency UPS power distribution wiring instead.</p><p>Ah well, there's always next year ...</p><hr noshade><p align=center>Previous : <a href="bofh26mar97.html">The B.O.F.H. and PFY help sort out a rival's PSIC problems ...</a><br>Next : <a href="bofh9apr97.html">It really hits the fan as the tables turn ...</a></p><p align=center>Back to <a href="../index.html#New97">The Bastard Menu</a>.</p></font></BODY></HTML>
