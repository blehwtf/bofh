We've put ourselves out for them over the months, stress-testing their notebooks and all that. The anvil business was a pure accident. And we still haven't figured how transactions with the local bookie managed to get a paragraph all of their own in the annual report, but I'm certain it wasn't Ops-induced.</p><p>Yet despite these tremendous efforts, the beancounters still insist that they need their own technical department. What's worse is that they seem to be making a decent fist of it. The guy they hired to run the network does seem to have a strange attitude to users, though - he genuinely believes that is duty to help them.</p><p>What's worse is his presence means that the accountants know the real value of the all the kit we've been buying over the past few years. It took some fancy footwork to ensure that the CEO didn't receive the information that the multi-directional, electro-magnetic, mobile communications devices that we'd billed at L1,200 were in fact cordless phones that the PFY's mate was flogging off at knockdown prices down the local market.</p><p>It's imperative that we bring the bean counters back into our domain for good. Not only are we missing our 'bonuses' that comes as part of Cap. Ex., but there are also rumblings around the building that other departments are getting bright ideas about our support efforts.</p><p>Fortunately, our boss has a vicious streak in him since his brief spell on the hell desk, so he's right behind us on this one. He's had it in for the accounts department since his own expenses claim for the 'wherever you want' hostess service was rejected as a genuine business expense.</p><p>It doesn't help that the bean counter's network manager is one of those irritating individuals who walks around with a smug smile on his face all the time. He looks like one of those alligators that you see when you're cruising in the everglades, except with a slightly worse complexion.</p><p>He guards his territory jealously, which presents something of a challenge.</p><p>&quot;I see your network's down again,&quot; he muses in passing.</p><p>The network accidentally crashed during an upgrade that we carrying out, just before the big race was about to start. &quot;It's amazing that people are prevented from working on the network every time there's a race meeting or big football match, isn't it?&quot; He smiles knowingly.</p><p>&quot;Yes, we're having a lot of trouble with bottlenecks,&quot; I find myself saying, before politely slamming the door in his face and pouring another Espresso.</p><p>A few days later I find myself 'broken down' in front of Smiley's car on my way to my parking space. He leans on the horn, but my vehicle's illness is looking terminal - or at least it is after I pocket one of the spark plugs.</p><p>&quot;I can't see what's wrong with it,&quot; I shout from under the bonnet.</p><p>&quot;I'll go off and get help.&quot;</p><p>I know that the car park attendant is not likely to spring into action; partly because he's about 90 and partly because I left him the tapes I happened to have of the head of personnel talking to the deputy sales manager about some new high performance techniques they wanted to try out - in the hotel down the road.</p><p>&quot;Quick,&quot; I shouted to the PFY. &quot;We've only got a few minutes.&quot;</p><p>We know that the board meeting is about to start soon. A few minor adjustments to the server and they're ready to roll.</p><p>Back in my own office, I switch on the audio-monitoring device - OK, bug.</p><p>We hear the CEO's dulcet tones. &quot;Now, I'd like to give you a demonstration of our latest product. I'd like to thank the technical whizz-kid in the financial department, Anthony, for his help in this demo. I believe we have a live feed to our R&amp;D labs.&quot;</p><p>Live feed, yes. R&amp;D Labs, no. The 3.30 at Newbury, definitely. Gasps from the board cause Smiley to be quickly summoned. His protests of innocence are to no avail as security, having emerged happy (and in my debt) from the car park attendant's hut, 'discover' the receipts for the local racing service in his desk.</p><p>The CEO is soon announcing the disbanding of the finance network, completely and for good. &quot;I think I'd better bring network support back under one roof - at least departments can't pursue their own activities that way.&quot;</p><p>Networking - there are winners and there are losers. And I always seem to get such good odds ...</p><hr noshade><p align=center>Previous : <a href="bofh21may97.html">The PFY is hardly the life and soul ...</a><br>Next : <a href="bofh4jun97.html">Local culinary delights with the Bastard ...</a></p><p align=center>Back to <a href="../index.html#New97">The Bastard Menu</a>.</p></font></BODY></HTML>
