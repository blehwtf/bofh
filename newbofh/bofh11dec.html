It's a challenge, but ...</strong></em></font></p><hr noshade><p>It's a sad day in network operations. The pimply-faced-youth has decided to move on. Apparently, there are greener pastures out there that have a greater attraction for the young and foolish. He's accepted a position as a networks engineer for an oil company where the workmates are reasonable and the pay compromisingly attractive.</p><p>With a small amount of sentimentality, he takes his leave after two weeks' notice, during which time the boss gains the not unfamiliar &quot;permanently hunted&quot; expression...</p><p>Apparently, a 'misprint' in the on-line phone directory has seen his 'wrong number' count rise dramatically. Changing phone numbers didn't seem to help either for some reason. Finding out that he'd put in for, and been granted, a transfer to Wales led to some quite involved and desperate legal wrangles that kept him busy for a couple of days.</p><p>The interview process for a PFY replacement begins and it seems obvious that the calibre of applicants is not even up to prospective PFY potential.</p><p>Me: &quot;A user complains about network speed. Would you investigate the problem or disconnect the network port altogether?&quot;</p><p>They: &quot;Investiga...&quot;</p><p>Me: &quot;Thank you, we'll let you know. Next!&quot;</p><p>Me: &quot;It's 4.54pm on a Friday and a user calls with a TCP/IP query. What do you do?&quot;</p><p>They: &quot;Answer their query?&quot;</p><p>Me: &quot;Trick question. You never answer the phone after 3pm on Friday! Even IF you're still at work! ...NEXT!&quot;</p><p>Me: &quot;You discover that the router firmware is several revisions out of date. Which do you do first: fill out a change-control form, arrange for storage of the old eproms, or order the upgrade?&quot;</p><p>They: &quot;Order the upgrade?&quot;</p><p>Me: &quot;No, crash the router every three hours until the boss begs you to upgrade as soon as possible, which will be four hours overtime at double rate. NEXT!&quot;</p><p>After two days of interviewing, the boss decides that he'll pick the applicant. Sure enough, he picks Ronald, one of the worst people imaginable, one with blatant depth perception problems. And the users love him which is always a warning sign. I make the most of a bad thing until I can figure out a plan.</p><p>&quot;OK Ron, I'll just show you ar...&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, Ronald, not Ron.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I see.&quot; I make a mental note to leave a few floor tiles balanced precariously for his benefit.</p><p>I prepare him for his career in network support by getting him to dust out all the cabling ducts.</p><p>Two days and one ducting accident later, Gerald starts as our latest PFY. A puerile addition to the workforce, but at least he's rude to the users. Still, he lacks the killer instinct which distinguishes a true networking professional from the amateurs. And the technical intelligence not to wear the raincoat with the large metal fasteners when he's directed to the roof to 'calibrate the satellite antenna' during a thunderstorm. Whoopsy. Still, surface burns apparently heal fairly quickly.</p><p>Gerald follows Ronald's example in taking extended sick leave, and I'm left to hold the fort by myself. Things are very hectic as there's a limit to the number of phone calls you can listen to whilst still leaving time to play network Doom against the old PFY over the Internet.</p><p>Also, it seems to be getting extremely difficult to get applicants for the PFY's position. In fact, nigh-on impossible. Apparently, word has got out to the agencies that there is safer work juggling chainsaws full tilt on a unicycle down Battersea Rise, and they're staying away in droves.</p><p>Because I'm so short-staffed, I don't get round to fixing a lot of the network errors that plague the place. Like the boss's UTP port, which suddenly appears to have gone open circuit. Luckily, I'm able to restore interim connectivity to him by giving him a spare 2400 modem so he can dial the internal extension of our modem banks. At 2400 baud, his file server really hums. Not to mention the power supply of the modem which draws so much power that the lights dim when he switches it on.</p><p>The boss is at his wit's end when I offer him a possibility. If he offered a finder's fee and a reasonable rate, I might be able to replace the PFY.</p><p>The boss jumps at the outstretched straw and mentions two very acceptable numbers. I give the PFY a call and make him an offer he could refuse but won't.</p><p>He doesn't.</p><p>A day later the PFY is back in business having returned from his holiday to a pay rise. What the boss doesn't know can't hurt him. Except for that carpet tack I drove into the base of his chair.</p><p>A high pitched scream filters through to the control room as I shake the PFY's hand.</p><p>I LOVE this business.</p><hr noshade><p align=center>Previous : <a href="bofh4dec.html">The PFY falls under a spell ...</a><br>  Next : <a href="bofh15jan97.html">A visitor from the auditors ...</a></p><p align=center>Back to <a href="../index.html#New">The Bastard Menu</a>.</p></font></BODY></HTML>
