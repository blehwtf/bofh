What makes you think that?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, my database updates are very slow.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What updates?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm capitalising the middle initial of all staff and contractors since 1991.&quot;</p><p>&quot;How ... useful. And you expect that to rocket through in a couple of seconds do you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;So it's not a disk problem?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, we'd know ahead of time if our disks were faulty - they have predictive failure.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Really?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, and I predict that they will fail in three seconds&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why's that?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Because I'm going to switch the power off.&quot;</p><p>I hear a flurry of keystrokes, but it's far too late to have any effect ...</p><p>Some wire jiggling and a loud click later and an impromptu transaction rollback is scheduled for disk restart time. The PFY, taking his education seriously, notes everything.</p><p>&quot;No witnesses,&quot; I mention as we move on to the next piece of kit, just in time to catch sight of the boss bounding past the observation window on his way in. Another &gt;CLICK&lt; and the evidence disappears.</p><p>&quot;What happened?&quot; the boss blurts, rushing up.</p><p>&quot;When?&quot; I ask, innocent and confused.</p><p>&quot;Just then - my database session has hung!&quot;</p><p>The PFY and I play dumb while the boss examines the system console screen for signs of bastardisation. None are evident, so after a few seconds he wanders off. When I'm sure he's not coming back I plug the console cable back in and watch the disk repair messages roll by.</p><p>The Computer Room phone rings again and the PFY reaches for it. I shake my head, mouthing the word &quot;Set-up&quot;. The boss is so predictable he belongs in the drive cabinet. I pick up the phone.</p><p>&quot;Help, my spreadsheet's gone funny!&quot; the user cries.</p><p>&quot;In what way?&quot; I ask</p><p>&quot;Well, the bit where it gets the info from the database has just stopped!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hmm. This sounds like you have an pre-revision embedded SQL statement.&quot;</p><p>&gt;DUMMY MODE ON&lt;</p><p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Okay, go back to your spreadsheet. There's an option in the menu somewhere to Examine Sql.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Uuuuum... Oh, yes, there it is!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Okay, click on it. A window pops up saying something like SELECT something FROM something else WHERE some other stuff.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, it does.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Cut out everything except the stuff between the FROM and the WHERE.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Okay, it's just HR_IDX, a comma, HR_SAL_SCALE a comma and HR_NAME.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Right, those are the erroneous SQLs that you want to get rid of. So before each word type 'DROP', then add a semi-colon instead of the comma. One drop command per line. Then check the 'auto-commit' box. Lastly, use your boss's username and password so that it fixes the bad SQL.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But I don't know his passw ...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, you do. It's his wife's name isn't it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Her middle name. But he said not to use it because it's got rights to ...&quot;</p><p>&quot;To repair SQL like you need to...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh... &gt;clickety-click&lt; ... That's funny. My spreadsheet has gone blank now!&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's right, because the repairs are taking place. Now when your boss gets him, tell him about the 'repairs' that you made.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Okay. Thanks!&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's okay. It's my pleasure. Really.&quot;</p><p>I haven't even lifted my hand from the receiver when it rings again.</p><p>&quot;Computer Room ...&quot; I sigh.</p><p>&quot;Hi, we're having a problem with the Human Resource Database. It's almost as if half the tables have disappeared!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes,&quot; I mutter, &quot;We've been doing a lot of work on that recently.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh. Well, is it working now?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course it is. And you'll be able to use it shortly ...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Great!&quot;</p><p>&quot;... when you get access. And the access charge today is five quid.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What?!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Each!&quot;</p><p>&quot;You're joking!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Per minute.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You can't do that!&quot;</p><p>&quot;You're right. I can't - it's my lunchtime, perhaps my assistant can help you.&quot;</p><p>I direct them to the PFY and head up to the staff cafeteria to check out today's contractor perk.</p><p>&quot;Ten quid,&quot; I hear the PFY chant.</p><p>&quot;What&quot;</p><p>&quot;Each. Per minute.&quot;</p><p>Fifteen minutes later he joins me in the cafeteria to outline the band of blood-seeking users lurking outside the computer room in wait for the return of the systems operators.</p><p>You can't pay for satisfaction like that. Unless you're a user of course.</p><hr noshade><p align=center>Previous : <a href="bofh24jul.html">The BOFH attempts some artistic expenses ...</a><br>Next : <a href="bofh4sep.html">The BOFH puts in a day on the helpdesk ...</a></p><p align=center>Back to <a href="../index.html#New">The Bastard Menu</a>.</p></font></BODY></HTML>
