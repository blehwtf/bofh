Having spent the Christmas period in the office, neatly combining the filling in of a timesheet liberally scattered with numbers in the 'overtime' column with the avoidance of certain members of the family, it's terribly irritating to see all these hung-over employees dragging themselves miserably back into the office with the sole intention of breaking my network.</p><p>You see, during the shutdown period I received not one single support call, confirming my theory that my network is indeed perfect, and that all faults are user-inflicted.</p><p>It would seem from the system logs that I wasn't the only one in over Christmas: looks like the head of engineering has been around, faxing out dozens of orders for bits and bobs to put in the new shake-test line they're hurrying to build down in Quality Assurance.</p><p>The gossip around the office, though, is that the CEO is really mad - the line was meant to be running in time for the New Year, and from all accounts, it's nowhere near completed.</p><p>The most interesting snippet from the network fax log is that the software patch I installed on the server seems to have kicked in for at least one outgoing call ...</p><p>It's an entertaining little patch, and fixes the most common problem with all networked fax systems around the world - the fact that they're terribly dull.</p><p>The update in question is simple, yet brilliant: the network manager specifies search and replace filters for outgoing messages, which can brighten up messages immensely if used properly. You can even program it to divert faxes to a different country according to your own parameters ...</p><p>The phone rings.</p><p>&quot;Good morning, you're the first caller of the year, how can I help you?&quot; (Sometimes, my charm surprises even myself)</p><p>&quot;Chief engineer here. Is the fax system working?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Certainly is, in fact, I've just been checking it a moment or two ago. Why? Are you having problems?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. I ordered some kit for the new QA line before the break, but the supplier reckons the fax never arrived. Can you check it out for me? I sent it on December the 22nd, and it claimed to get there OK. The purchase order number is PE4456.&quot;</p><p>A quick 'grep' on the fax log turns up the fax in question.</p><p>&quot;Well, it's here in the system log, and it certainly went OK. Quantity 48, product description 'Vibrator (three-phase, heavy-duty)'. Perhaps your supplier is trying it on.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, that's probably right. Many thanks.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You're welcome&quot;.</p><p>I wonder ...</p><p>The phone rings. CLI says it's Goods Inwards.</p><p>&quot;Machine room.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Goods Inwards here. We have a delivery with no contact name. The supplier says it was ordered by fax - can you find out who sent the order with that fancy gadget of yours?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sure, no problem. What's the order number?&quot;</p><p>&quot;PE4456.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Let's see ... Yes, that was ordered on the 22nd of last month, by the head of engineering.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Thanks mate.&quot;</p><p>I'm sure I hear sniggering as the phone is put down.</p><p>Time, and several levels of Doom III (beta, naturally) pass uneventfully before there's a knock at the door. Deftly switching Doom to 'Boss Mode', I motion the chief engineer to enter.</p><p>&quot;Something's wrong with your fax system,&quot; he blurts.</p><p>&quot;Really? How come?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You know that fax I mentioned? I just tried to re-send it, but it hasn't got there.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, let's test the system.&quot;</p><p>I compose a quick fax on my PC, plug one of the old fax machines I've got lying in the corner into a spare line, and click 'send'. The machine springs into life, faithfully reproducing the test message.</p><p>Well, it would, wouldn't it - I didn't put the word 'vibrator' in my message ... so it didn't get redirected to Siggi's Sex Emporium in Rotterdam ...</p><p>&quot;There you go,&quot; I proudly exclaim to my spanner-wielding colleague. &quot;Nothing wrong with that. You'll have to tell your suppliers that their machine is on the blink.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh well, thanks for checking.&quot;</p><p>Serves him right for doubting my systems.</p><p>The phone rings again.</p><p>&quot;Machine room, BOFH speaking.&quot;</p><p>&quot;CEO here. Tell me, have you seen Bradshaw from engineering? They tell me he was on his way to see you about a system problem.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, he just walked out of the door. Why?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, I'm just wondering why Goods Inwards have brought me a box containing four dozen three-speed sex aids, as ordered by our engineering friend from Siggi's Sex Emporium in Rotterdam. Don't suppose you can shed any light?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, I can certainly go through the fax log for you - it's all here in black and white ...&quot;</p><hr noshade><p align=center>Previous : <a href="bofh13dec.html">The BOFH spreads peace and good will ...</a><br>Next : <a href="bofh17jan.html">The BOFH has an appraisal ...</a></p><p align=center>Back to <a href="../index.html#New">The Bastard Menu</a>.</p></font></BODY></HTML>
