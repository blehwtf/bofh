Discarding the thought that he might have found a higher meaning to life than taking the world record for impersonating a paper-weight, I decide to see what's on his mind.</p><p>&quot;Is there a problem?&quot; I ask, appearing concerned with his welfare.</p><p>&quot;Well ... no. No problem. Just having some trouble with my car as it happens&quot;.</p><p>&quot;The royal blue monster in the basement? Not starting then?&quot; I prompt.</p><p>&quot;No, no, starts well, runs well. Too well in fact. That's the problem&quot;.</p><p>Knowing what's coming, I prompt yet again. &quot;Too Well?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I got another speeding ticket this morning&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Really? How many's that in total then?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Three. But the strange thing is, the car was on Cruise Control and well under the speed limit. Yet when I looked at the speedo later on, I was way over the limit&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Really?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. But the really strange thing is that the radar detector noticed nothing&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Well, the police do switch bands from time to time to defeat the detectors&quot;, I say, trying to ease his curiosity.</p><p>&quot;But I've only had it a week! If I didn't know better, I'd swear the car picks the worst time to accelerate. As if cruise control and the radar detector are working in cahoots!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Out of the mouths of babes ...&quot; I mutter.</p><p>&quot;Pardon?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I said, the police must be hiding out of the way&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Oh&quot;.</p><p>He wanders off contemplating life without a licence while I pop down to the basement and swap my recently created radar peripheral into the pimply-faced-youth's car. He's been getting complacent recently, so it'll do him good to get a small reminder of what life on the edge means.</p><p>With that little trick nicely transferred to the next recipient, I head back to the lift. I am suddenly assailed by twin-tone air horns at close proximity. Behind me, a sporty red convertible and owner are impatiently awaiting my progress. The name on the car park plaque is transferred to long-term memory in an instant.</p><p>Back in the office, I realise I've been neglecting the education of the PFY and decide to rectify this forthwith. I recount to the PFY the events in the basement concerning the rather too impatient sales manager in the sporty convertible.</p><p>&quot;Shall we disconnect his line?&quot; The PFY asks, keenly interested.</p><p>&quot;No, no&quot;, I reply. &quot;This is a special case calling for a special measure. Grab that book over there&quot;.</p><p>&quot;The one with the metal covers?&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's the one&quot;.</p><p>He grabs the book, lifts it and falls to the floor. Seconds later he regains consciousness.</p><p>&quot;What happened?&quot; he asks in a daze.</p><p>&quot;The oldest trick in the book. 'Which book?' you ask ... the Bastard Operator Guide. The Tome of Hell&quot;.</p><p>&quot;But what happened?&quot;</p><p>&quot;When you picked the book up, the microswitch in the basement activated the chunky inverter which supplies a healthy dose of voltage to the covers. You can't be too careful with the Book&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Oh&quot;.</p><p>He's not happy, but good education has never been cheap.</p><p>&quot;OK&quot;, I say. &quot;Grab some rubber gloves and turn to page 43, bottom paragraph&quot;.</p><p>&quot;This it? About Internet news?&quot; he asks.</p><p>&quot;The very one. Now, perhaps you can help me compose the message that our friend will be sending to a large number of sex-based newsgroups. What sort of perversion will he be interested about in hearing from people?&quot;</p><p>Five minutes later we have a virtual masterpiece, guaranteed to appeal to a large number of the strangest people on the net.</p><p>&quot;Shall I post it now?&quot; the PFY asks.</p><p>&quot;Not quite yet. You realise that this is going to generate an enormous amount of e-mail that will flood the server, causing the system administrator, a man with all the discretion of a loud hailer, to investigate?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You mean he'll tell?&quot;</p><p>&quot;We can't rely on that. Make the return address the head telephonist. It'll be round the building before someone has the guts to tell him!&quot;</p><p>&quot;You really are a complete bastard!&quot;</p><p>&quot;In the flesh, on the keyboard, and wading through people's personal lives!&quot; I reply, with a measure of pride.</p><p>Later that day, I pop down to the basement to watch a figure emerge from the lift and slink to the little red convertible. From the look on his face, the propositions haven't only come from external sources ...</p><p>As he rockets off for a long memory-obscuring holiday, I head back to my office to finish the day's labour, pausing but momentarily to drop his sump plug into the rubbish bin ...</p><hr noshade><p align=center>Previous : <a href="bofh28feb.html">The BOFH and the ioniser ...</a><br>Next : <a href="bofh13mar.html">The BOFH's Black Wednesday ...</a></p><p align=center>Back to <a href="../index.html#New">The Bastard Menu</a>.</p></font></BODY></HTML>
