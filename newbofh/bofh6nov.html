I turn from the calibration screen (and US Military movie channel that it has unfortunately become irrevocably locked on to), and check the message.</p><p>To receive a message is strange as my normal e-mail address simply discards messages once it's forwarded the sender's e-mail address on to several bulk e-mail marketing lists.</p><p>Examining the message, I find it appears to have come from inside the company. Strange, as my e-mail address is known to no-one but the pimply-faced-youth. I know it's not from the PFY as he's organising the distribution of the recently delivered phone directories.</p><p>Curiouser and curiouser ...</p><p>Further examination reveals that the e-mail has in fact come from the new helpdesk (alias helldesk) software which has trolled the password file of the mail server to build its recipient list. The message itself is anathema to me - a helldesk request.</p><p>I hate helldesk software, always have. The thought of some piece of software not accepting the resolution date of 'When I get around to it, if I get around to it' annoys me intensely. Intensely.</p><p>So intensely, I log in to the helldesk server.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, one of its users calls me.</p><p>&quot;Hi, it's the helpdesk here. We were wondering if you knew what's up with our server?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No idea,&quot; I reply. &quot;Why?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well it's got very slow on updating entries.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Really? Perhaps it's just poorly designed software with limited scaleability,&quot; I reply, whipping a couple of convenient buzzwords out of the bag.</p><p>&quot;Check to see if it changes over time - it could just be running some internal journalling procedure.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, of course! Okay, thanks.&quot;</p><p>She rings off and I crank up the disk-exerciser software from 80 per cent activity to 95 per cent and wind the seek distance from 'Minimal' to 'Potentially Destructive'.</p><p>Luckily, I have a patched version of the exerciser which doesn't enforce the standard 15-minute time limit on destructive testing. Well - lucky for some, in any case.</p><p>&quot;Five quid says it won't last the night,&quot; I call to the PFY.</p><p>&quot;No deal,&quot; the PFY replies, after checking out my 'testing' parameters, remembering all too well the extremely high failure rate of the disks we 'tested' for the beancounters prior to installation. Eighty-seven per cent within the first month if I remember correctly. And the real tragedy was that they installed an incompatible version of their desktop back-up software too.</p><p>Still, a lot of them probably needed the late night typing practice.</p><p>Sure enough, the next day there's a very unfortunate head crash on the helldesk server, and everything grinds to a halt. The boss takes a personal interest in the events, but can find no evidence of foul play. I notice that he is personally looking after the helldesk software tape and not trusting the tape library. Hmmm.</p><p>I give the PFY the boss's new Yellow Pages to deliver. We share a knowing glance ...</p><p>The helldesk server is reinstalled and configured and its entries are re-keyed. A repeat of yesterday's e-mail message arrives in my e-mail queue, just as I notice one of my cron jobs on the server getting stuck in an infinite loop and setting the clock back by five minutes. Every five minutes. But I'm sure the helldesk resolution alarms won't be affected ...</p><p>Dedicated to the cause, I call in on the boss.</p><p>&quot;I thought I'd just take the helpdesk software tape to the tape library,&quot; I offer helpfully.</p><p>He hands it over and I accidentally drop it on the floor. In my enthusiasm to pick it up it gets crushed by a chair leg. Four times.</p><p>I look up to see the boss's smiling visage. In his hand is a tape indelibly marked 'Helpdesk Software Backup'.</p><p>&quot;Wasn't born yesterday,&quot; he smirks, placing the tape down on the only cleanish area of his desk - on top of a recently delivered Yellow Pages.</p><p>A brief 'hmm' later, I exit the office.</p><p>Getting back to my office, I refire up the disk exerciser at 97 per cent and 'Definitely Destructive'.</p><p>The next day, horror of horrors, the helldesk server encounters another head crash. I go straight to the boss's office.</p><p>&quot;I just thought I'd take the helpdesk software tape to the technicians so that they can reinstall it,&quot; I say.</p><p>The boss smiles and shakes his head sadly.</p><p>&quot;Oh,&quot; I respond. &quot;Well, in that case, I'll just get back to work. You haven't seen the portable bulk eraser have you? I'm concerned because it's really sensitive to shocks and things. That's why I made it a protective case out of one of our left over Yellow Pages ...&quot;</p><p>The boss's face takes on a slightly pasty look as he glances at the phone book on his desk.</p><p>&quot;Ah ... that must be it,&quot; I say, and wander out of his office, having found my missing hardware.</p><p>Play with fire, get burnt ...</p><hr noshade><p align=center>Previous : <a href="bofh30oct.html">Don't let the Boss set up a network ...</a><br>Next : <a href="bofh13nov.html">The B.O.F.H. engages in some underhand practices ...</a></p><p align=center>Back to <a href="../index.html#New">The Bastard Menu</a>.</p></font></BODY></HTML>
