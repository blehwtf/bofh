Later, behind closed doors, the PFY and I form a plan, then invite the boss et al back again.</p><p>&quot;Step One: Fire the PFY!&quot;</p><p>&quot;How? Why?&quot; the boss blurts.</p><p>&quot;Embezzling something.&quot;</p><p>&quot;If that were grounds for dismissal, you would've been ...&quot;</p><p>A stony gaze at the boss silences him and I continue.</p><p>&quot;Step Two: I have lunch with one of their network guys and on the way out I drop (in front of their security cameras), and then quickly hide in a suspicious manner, a data tape with their company logo on the front.</p><p>Step Three: The PFY, invaluable in the future plans of our takeover because of his intimate knowledge of the way we work, steps into a recently vacated network guy position.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sounds good,&quot; the boss chirps.</p><p>Three days later we're set. I'm making our company look an unattractive investment by falsifying memos about future criminal liability from defects in the furniture production line, then leaking them to the press.</p><p>Of course, no pressman worth his salt substitute would believe the memos without proof (being men of integrity), so I sacrifice a couple of bean-counter limbs for the purpose of, &quot;Stress Testing Production Line Furniture,&quot; (&quot;the cause&quot;) and make sure the papers are on hand to see the ambulance being loaded.</p><p>Meantime the PFY is stepping through the entire first three chapters of the Bastard Manual, wrecking havoc all round. The oxy-acetylene in the halon cannister was a nice touch, and took out half a warehouse before they realised what had happened and switched the automatic extinguishers off. A simple typo on a refill form can make such a difference ...</p><p>His technical advice appears to be second to none judging by the continual arrival of replacement equipment and deskside fire extinguishers.</p><p>Meantime their Fire Alarms have been used more in last three days than in the previous two years and the route to and from the Fire Station has a 24-hour parking ban.</p><p>I tried calling him but due to a wiring maintenance mix-up people are too scared to answer the phones. Must be the stigma attached to electrical burns. Page 73 if memory serves me correct.</p><p>I'm continuing as normal, repatching a repeater when the boss comes to see me.</p><p>&quot;It's about these accidents,&quot; he says.</p><p>&quot;What accidents?&quot; I ask</p><p>&quot;You know what accidents. They have to stop. Why is the equipment being sent to the accounts department for testing anyway? We've got a perfectly capable testing team.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, but they're all good sorts,&quot; I reply.</p><p>&quot;What?! Well, I don't care, it has to stop! There are only three accountants left!&quot;</p><p>&quot;No ...&quot; looking at my watch, &quot;... there's ...&quot;</p><p>A thud and a muffled scream from the floor above punctuate my sentence.</p><p>&quot;... Two. I'm guessing the wardrobe and drawer unit he was looking at did not pass the 'heavy weight placed in an elevated position' test.</p><p>Speaking of heavy weights, you haven't seen the large box of full-height hard drives normally in my office have you?&quot;</p><p>He trundles off without a word to rest in his office ...</p><p>I get to my office and the phone is ringing. One of our equipment suppliers wants a site visit with a prospective customer. What the hell, it'll kill time till the real action starts...</p><p>The phone rings and as I'm in time-kill mode, I answer it.</p><p>&quot;My phone's broken!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then how are you calling me?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&quot;I'm using another phone, stupid.&quot;</p><p>Stupid?!?!</p><p>&quot;I see,&quot; I whisper, &quot;and what was your number?&quot;</p><p>He tells me. I look it up.</p><p>&quot;Ah, Mr 0898&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don't know what you're talking about.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Are you sure? I have several VERY PROGRESSIVE tapes here for you to listen to if you'd like.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Err ... that won't be necessary.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Are you sure?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, forget I called.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well I'd like to forget you called, but the only thing that makes me forget is a couple of bottles of single malt scotch. The good stuff, not that cheap crap they serve up at the bar ...&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'll drop them off shortly.&quot;</p><p>Ten minutes later the transaction is completed and I end the day by playing one of the tapes into his home answerphone. It was for the best, those calls were just a cry for help ...</p><hr noshade><p align=center>Previous : <a href="bofh24apr.html">The BOFH does some Future Plannning ...</a><br>Next : <a href="bofh8may.html">The BOFH meets an unexpected guest ...</a></p><p align=center>Back to <a href="../index.html#New">The Bastard Menu</a>.</p></font></BODY></HTML>
