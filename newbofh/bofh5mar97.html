And he just won't wear it ...</strong></em></font></p><hr noshade><p>Something smells fishy. Very fishy indeed. Positively tuna casserole.</p><p>The boss is in a good mood. Almost radiant, in fact. It can only bode bad tidings, especially as his phone log notes that he's been talking to one of the company lawyers.</p><p>Sadly, the text of the conversation was lost due to an oversight on the part of the PFY, who forgot to change the tapes on the voice recorder. A mistake he won't be making twice if the power stapler has anything to do with it ...</p><p>It's obvious something's up - he's scheduled a meeting with us at 10.30am, a time normally quite unknown to us.</p><p>The smug expression on his face leaves me in no doubt that he feels his position is unassailable.</p><p>&quot;Gentlemen,&quot; he says, with an uncharacteristic show of camaraderie, &quot;Why don't you take an hour's unpaid leave to go and get changed?&quot;</p><p>The PFY is in like a shot.</p><p>&quot;And why don't you take an hour's paid leave to go and get f...&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'M SORRY?!&quot; I interrupt, saving the PFY from the quagmire of disciplinary action, &quot;As you're well aware, we're permitted to wear attire applicable to the nature of our position.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Unless&quot;, the boss says, holding up a heavily highlighted copy of a contract not unlike the ones signed when we joined the company, &quot;your position involves interaction with ...&quot;</p><p>He pauses for a moment, giving us time to fill in the blank whilst simultaneously savouring every millisecond ...</p><p>&quot;... begins with C ...&quot;, he adds, &quot;... ends with S ...&quot;</p><p>Neither the PFY nor I are forthcoming, so the boss finishes.</p><p>&quot;CLIENTS.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh,&quot; says the PFY. &quot;That wasn't the C word I was thinking of. But I think we're talking about the same people though ...&quot;</p><p>I cut through the PFY's bolshiness and come straight to the point.</p><p>&quot;We don't deal with clients,&quot; I explain, as if I'm talking to a simple-minded child.</p><p>&quot;AHEM,&quot; the Boss replies, priming the bombshell he has hidden. &quot;As of the initiation of our ISO and Advanced Helpdesk Initiatives, the helpdesk and support staff are now officially your clients.&quot; His smug expression says it all. He's been doing his homework on this one.</p><p>&quot;And you suggest?&quot; I ask</p><p>&quot;Standard client representative dress. Suit...&quot;</p><p>The PFY gasps.</p><p>&quot;...business shirt, tie...&quot;</p><p>I suppress the gag reflex in my throat.</p><p>&quot;...and of course hard-soled shoes, preferably leather.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well,&quot; I rally, &quot;it's not often we agree on things, but I'd have to admit you do have a point. I'll be ready by the morning.&quot;</p><p>The PFY's widened eyes lead me to believe he doubts my sanity. But the boss is not a complete idiot. Well, actually he is, but I cut him some slack for the moment, as he can smell the rat but just can't figure where it is. We leave him to ponder...</p><p>The next day heads turn as the PFY and I stroll into work in the required apparel, and present the receipt for our new attire to the boss, who promptly has some dramatic form of seizure.</p><p>An hour later he's revived by the company nurse, but not before the PFY and I have a couple of cracks at the task with a impromptu defibrillator made from pieces of his desktop machine.</p><p>&quot;Where am I?&quot; the boss asks.</p><p>&quot;In your office,&quot; I reply. &quot;You had some sort of fit!&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's right. What the BLOODY HELL IS THAT?!&quot; he asks, pointing at the receipt.</p><p>&quot;It's the invoice for our clothes. Remember in our contract it specifically states that any specially-made safety apparel is to be provided by the company. Do you know how hard it is to get Italian-made steel-cap shoes with that professional look with only six hours notice? They had to fly them in specially!&quot;</p><p>&quot;You won't get away with it!&quot; he snarls, noticing again the large collection of figures at the bottom of the page.</p><p>&quot;Now don't you worry,&quot; I respond soothingly. &quot;You've had a nasty turn, but we've taken care of everything. One of the nice accountants with a predilection for viewing Internet strip-shows was only too happy to supply the blank cheque to us yesterday afternoon ...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then I'll have it STOPPED!&quot; the boss says smugly, victory in sight.</p><p>So much in sight in fact, it obscures the still live remains of his PC from his vision...</p><p>I give him a good 10 minutes of heart boosting electricity before I call the nurse back again, during which time the PFY calls our clothing supplier to advise a quick clearance time ...</p><p>And they say a blue pinstripe is dressing for success ...</p><hr noshade><p align=center>Previous : <a href="bofh26feb97.html">The B.O.F.H. puts in a week on the Helldesk ...</a><br>Next : <a href="bofh12mar97.html">The B.O.F.H. is labelled Politically Unsound ...</a></p><p align=center>Back to <a href="../index.html#New97">The Bastard Menu</a>.</p></font></BODY></HTML>
