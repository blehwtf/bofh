Is that Network Support?&quot; the user asks over hands-free.</p><p>I remove our topological LAN Viewing equipment (VR Glasses) and disconnect from our powerful network analysis server (VR Tank-Combat Games Machine) and direct my attention to the caller.</p><p>Caller-Id indicates a user at beancounter central is on the line.</p><p>&quot;Yes, this is network support,&quot; I reply.</p><p>&quot;Oh. I have a problem with FTP-ing from an Internet ftp server in Brussels. It keeps dropping my connection just after I've downloaded a megabyte.&quot;</p><p>The PFY looks over to me with a cheesy grin and scribbles out a hasty message: &quot;TODAY'S LIMIT 1024K&quot; and points at his packet filter software.</p><p>He's getting good.</p><p>&quot;Ah yes,&quot; I say, flicking over the page on my excuse calendar, &quot;We're getting a lot of this at the moment. We believe it's due to...Network Destabilisation from Low Voltage Fluorescent Lamp Spikes.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Come again?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, when a fluorescent lamp starts, it sends a spike back down the power cable which in turn induces an interference current in network cabling nearby. In low voltage circuits this effect is magnified.&quot;</p><p>&gt;DUMMY MODE ON&lt;</p><p>[From the bastard Glossary:</p><p>DUMMY MODE, n. The mode in which a user, overcome by technical terms, will believe, and/or do, anything he or she is told.]</p><p>&quot;DUH-HUH. So what do I do?&quot;</p><p>[Told you so.]</p><p>&quot;Well, today nothing, as there's obviously something generating spikes. How big was the file you wanted?&quot;</p><p>&quot;About 1.6 Megs&quot;</p><p>I scribble: &quot;TOMORROW'S LIMIT 1.59 MEGS&quot; and pass it to the PFY.</p><p>&quot;Well,&quot; I respond, &quot;are there any low-voltage fluorescent tubes on your floor?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don't know.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, they'll be smallish, bar-like lights - usually inside signs or displays.&quot;</p><p>&quot;THE FIRE EXIT SIGNS!!&quot; my caller shouts from the end of the garden path he's been led down.</p><p>&quot;Of course!&quot; I cry, sharing his enthusiasm. &quot;They're right above doorways, which is where our cable is fed. Well, there's probably nothing you can do about it now, as we can't refeed our network cabling, I'm sorry,&quot;</p><p>&quot;What about if we moved the exit signs?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, I'm afraid WE couldn't do that, even if we had the time.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, we simply do not have the time to remove the cable duct covers, slide the exit signs along the duct for a couple of yards to get them away from the data cables, then replace the covers in the newly vacated space for every exit sign on your floor.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh&quot; he replies, mind ticking over almost audibly. &quot;Never mind then. I'll just try bringing the file across in pieces then.&quot;</p><p>I hang up then cross out the 1024K on the PFY's bit of paper and put 50K in its place, nodding to him to action it.</p><p>&quot;He won't do it you know...&quot; the PFY says, so little faith in one so young.</p><p>&quot;10 Quid?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&quot;You're on,&quot; he says, thinking naive &quot;easy money&quot; thoughts.</p><p>The next morning comes and I stash a crisp new 10 pound note in my wallet with a smug grin. The PFY notes with disgust the repositioning of the Exit signs halfway along the walls, well clear of the &quot;network cabling&quot; in the doorways.</p><p>&quot;Never underestimate the desperation of a user,&quot; I mention, furthering his education once more.</p><p>To take his mind off it, I get him to install the new 'Infra Red Wireless LAN Transceivers' (infra-red cameras), in the floors mentioned and drop some cable boxes around the place so it looks like we're going to do something.</p><p>Later that afternoon, Network Control is crammed to capacity with a dozen or so fellow network engineers from other companies.</p><p>&quot;You all know the rules&quot; I state, &quot;20 quid a player, except for the PFY and I, who, as host, get first pick of a free player&quot;</p><p>Nods all round as the PFY takes the bets and we switch on the gaming screens. Once the choosing of players is complete, we're ready to go.</p><p>&quot;Let the game commence!&quot; I shout, flicking the switch to cut the lights to Beancounter central and its stairwells. I then activate the fire alarms.</p><p>&quot;The person whose player is the first to the safety of a stairwell, takes the pool!&quot;</p><p>Through the infrared monitor we watch the pandemonium break out, as in the darkness, everyone runs for apparent safety.</p><p>The toll of the newly shifted exit signs is fairly high and will probably leave an impression on the wall that only a thick coat of plaster will put right.</p><p>Next on the obstacle list (for the smarter contestants) are the boxes of cable the PFY left randomly in the cubicle &quot;corridors&quot; earlier on.</p><p>&quot;It's like a multi-ball game of pinball down there!&quot; the PFY cries watching in disbelief.</p><p>Ten minutes later I'm counting my winnings - of course I did back the mover of the signs in the first place....</p><p>And they say there's no money in networking any more.</p><hr noshade><p align=center>Previous : <a href="bofh10jul.html">The BOFH becomes a contract killer ...</a><br>Next : <a href="bofh24jul.html">The BOFH attempts some artistic expenses ...</a></p><p align=center>Back to <a href="../index.html#New">The Bastard Menu</a>.</p></font></BODY></HTML>
