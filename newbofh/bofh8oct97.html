It's an external call, which is more welcome than the internal variety.</p><p>As luck would have it, it's my slave-trader come to take me out for the twice-yearly drink-up, food-stuff and pep-talk to guarantee my custom in the years ahead. True, I could go back to contracting direct as I used to, but this way someone else has to foot the bill for a six-monthly night of excess. The PFY and I arrange to skive off early and meet him in a local drinking establishment. The night promises to be interesting...</p><p>Sure enough, the next day, the PFY and I are somewhat slow on the uptake. Whilst the idea of doing the Monopoly-Board Pub Crawl sounded like a good idea under the influence of lager at 10 past 5, at 10 past 10 in the morning, enthusiasm has tapered off somewhat.</p><p>So much so in fact that the presence of a user in our office provokes only a minor response.</p><p>The PFY reaches half-heartedly for the power stapler, only slightly modified with extra torque on the firing spring, a 'rapid fire' setting, and the removal of the safety guard. </p><p>&quot;Hang on!&quot; I cry, not wanting to endure several hundred CLACKs and miscellaneous screams in my current condition. &quot;Can I help you?&quot; I ask the user.</p><p>&quot;I'm after a UTP cable for my computer,&quot; the user asks, displaying an education in networking that's generally prohibited at user level. (For their own good of course.)</p><p>&quot;How long would you like it?&quot; I ask tiredly.</p><p>&quot;Well, I'd like to keep it if it's all right with you,&quot; he adds, chuckling away at a joke that's so old Noah used it buying wood for the Ark.</p><p>&quot;Sure, just grab one from the brown cardboard box in the corner.&quot;</p><p>The user contentedly wanders off with a cable and the PFY corners me.</p><p>&quot;Are you all right?&quot; the PFY asks in a strangely caring voice. &quot;You helped a user?&quot;</p><p>&quot;By giving him one of the dud cables that we sell for copper scrap? I was just buying time till my hangover goes. Mark my words, he'll be back.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh,&quot; the PFY responds, realising that even on a bad day the old CPU's still ticking over. He pauses for a moment - something plainly on his mind.</p><p>&quot;Don't you ever worry that we lie to users too much?&quot;</p><p>A Mid-Job Crisis. I should have seen it coming. All the symptoms were there - the care for others, the slow-draw of the stapler.</p><p>&quot;Don't be ridiculous!&quot; I cry, wanting to nip the surge of conscience in the bud. &quot;Users expect to be lied to, like Insurance companies and the Inland Revenue. It's your right - no your duty - to misinform in the interests of technological advancement.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, I've been thinking - I don't know if I'm really cut out for this job.&quot;</p><p>It's worse that I thought. Before the PFY can go on, I ring the helpdesk and give them his number for 'problem calls'. Surprisingly enough, they start putting users through almost immediately.</p><p>&quot;Hello?&quot;</p><p>Two hours later the damage is done and the PFY's back to normal. The user who wanted to know why the 'follow-me' service wasn't working on her phone was probably the straw that broke the camel's back. It took a while for the PFY to realise she was carrying her desk phone around the building with her, but as a veteran hand at these things I expected no less.</p><p>He's back on form by the time my amateur networker returns to the office.</p><p>&quot;That cable you gave me is broken!&quot; he cries in a distressed manner.</p><p>&quot;I don't think so,&quot; the PFY says calmly. &quot;We ran a cable check on all of them.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's true,&quot; I respond. &quot;Except of course we didn't do the humidity differential test because our multimeter's broken.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course,&quot; the PFY gasps.</p><p>&quot;That'll be it,&quot; our user cries, feigning knowledge.</p><p>&quot;Tell you what,&quot; I say to our ardent amateur. &quot;You grab one end of the cable and go into the comms corridor and just hold the plug in your mouth. You'll feel a slight tingle if the humidity differential's OK and nothing if the cable's broken.&quot;</p><p>Seconds later the silence of the comms corridor is punctuated by a scream and a series of thuds.</p><p>&quot;Whoops,&quot; the PFY blurts. &quot;Plugged it into the 90V AC Phone-Bell test transformer by mistake.&quot;</p><p>The thuds next door stop, which can only mean our user's managed to bite through the cable to disconnect himself.</p><p>&quot;Good to have you back,&quot; I say as the PFY unplugs the evidence. I mean cable.</p><p>&quot;Good to be back.&quot;</p><p>Isn't it funny how things work out for the best?</p><hr noshade><p align=center>Previous : <a href="bofh1oct97.html">The boss tries to oust the BOFH and the PFY again ...</a><br>Next : <a href="bofh15oct97.html">The PFY comes to the rescue with a cunning plan ...</a></p><p align=center>Back to <a href="../index.html#New97">The Bastard Menu</a>.</p></font></BODY></HTML>
