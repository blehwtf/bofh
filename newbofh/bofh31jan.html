He's keen to please, but I'll cure that in a couple of weeks after exposure to some of the more demanding clients ...</p><p>Speaking of exposure and clients, one of our more annoying ones resigned recently after some rather personal images were left in the memory of the &quot;loaner&quot; digital camera. It's all very strange too, as the erase function was working perfectly when I 'serviced' the camera a week ago. The incident would've been less severe had the finder of the images not downloaded one into the Windows Start-up Screen of everyone on his floor. The victim claimed in his defence, of course, that the image had been touched up, but consensus of opinion was that it wasn't the image that was getting that treatment. Dirty sod.</p><p>PFY is concerned, and obviously needs counselling about it.</p><p>&quot;What's the problem?&quot;, I ask.</p><p>&quot;Well, it's just that I don't understand how the image could have got onto all those PCs&quot;.</p><p>&quot;I see. I guess someone managed to break into the application server and forced it to upload it to certain desktops&quot;.</p><p>&quot;But the server is protected by a password and so is the version control program, so how did they get in?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Someone must have found out the passwords&quot;, I reply, waiting for the inevitable.</p><p>&quot;But only you and I know the passwords, and I only found out yesterday&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Did you write the passwords down?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well yes, but they're locked in my drawer&quot;.</p><p>I shake my head sadly. &quot;And who has keys to your drawer?&quot;, I ask.</p><p>&quot;Just you and me&quot;.</p><p>&quot;And did you do it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Then, by a process of elimination, it must have been me that opened your drawer, read your passwords and logged into the server as you&quot;.</p><p>&quot;You did it?!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course. You don't think anyone else in the department could, do you? Hell, the only other person with overriding access is the system manager, and he's so slow he needs a tow-rope!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why did you do it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Because you needed to learn the value of security. I'm sure that piece of knowledge will serve you well in your next job which will probably start sometime after tomorrow&quot;.</p><p>&quot;B..b..b&quot;</p><p>&quot;No use butting&quot;.</p><p>&quot;But, I was going to say that surely you're not going to make me tell Uncle Brian this was my fault, are you?&quot;</p><p>Warning Bells On!</p><p>&quot;Uncle Brian?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Uncle Brian, you know, on the 6th floor. The big office with the leather furniture. I'd hate to disagree with your report to the CEO&quot;.</p><p>UNCLE Brian ... Uncle Brian, the CEO. I should have known that this wasn't a run-of-the-mill shafting. This was big-time.</p><p>&quot;Well, perhaps it's best to put it down to some outside hacker&quot;, I say, in what I believe to be a kindly manner.</p><p>&quot;Or some inside hacker ...&quot;.</p><p>PFY smiles, looking menacing.</p><p>The sneaky bastard! Perhaps he has potential after all!</p><p>&quot;... like our Boss&quot;, he adds, letting me off the hook entirely.</p><p>There but for the grace of god ...</p><p>&quot;OK&quot;, I say, seizing the opportunity before he can realise the enormous potential of blackmail. &quot;You tell Uncle Brian and I'll slip your keys into the top desk of his drawer&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Done!&quot;</p><p>Ten minutes later we watch on with interest and sugary donuts as yet another boss is escorted from the hallowed halls of hell.</p><p>&quot;You realise he was the one that got you this job&quot;, I say.</p><p>&quot;Yeah, but no point in being sentimental&quot;, he replies.</p><p>Definite Potential.</p><p>&quot;Right, what shall we do now?&quot; he asks, keen to learn.</p><p>&quot;Well, I think it's about time we pull the plug on a remote site, then phone them to tell them it's because the labels on their EPROMs have expired and they need to remove them in a well-lit area, like some bright sunshine .&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Won't that ...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yup.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Let's do it&quot;.</p><p>You can't PAY for a job like this ...</p><hr noshade><p align=center>Previous : <a href="bofh24jan.html">The BOFH educates a PFY ...</a><br>Next : <a href="bofh7feb.html">The BOFH, the user and the printer ...</a></p><p align=center>Back to <a href="../index.html#New">The Bastard Menu</a>.</p></font></BODY></HTML>
