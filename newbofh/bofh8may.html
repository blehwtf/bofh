Their only purpose is to pretend to a customer that the stuff really does work like it says in the brochure by finding a site that's worked out where the manual went wrong and fixed it.</p><p>If it wasn't for the free lunch and the chance to blackmail a good price for our next order, they'd never make the front door.</p><p>The visit should follow typical form: supplier lies to customer; I extort goods to support this flagrant misinformation; a walk-around tour; a free lunch, and promises from me to help out if they have any future difficulties.</p><p>In other words, a day that would turn Pinnochio into a kindling machine.</p><p>As 10am rolls around, I get a call from the front desk about my visitors.</p><p>A quick look at the CCTV shows me everything is as expected; our supplier with his customer. Except for one small thing; the visitor is none other than the head network guy of our rival company. Something smells a little rotten, and it's not the Danish cheese in the staff cafeteria.</p><p>I slip downstairs with the boss wondering exactly what the purpose of this visit is. Some show of strength probably, but what form this will take is unknown. Obviously a lapse in reporting on the part of the Pimply-Faced-Youth which I'll rectify with a cattle-prod at our next meeting.</p><p>The technical competence of my rival is identified when I notice his rubber-soled isolator shoes. The electric doorknob was a waste of time ...</p><p>... but then again, perhaps not, as the supplier gives himself a belt he won't remember in a hurry, along with his name and who he works for.</p><p>The opposition immediately identifies himself as a network professional by perusing the bosses swipe card PIN number, 'accidentally' shutting the bosses hand in a door - twice - then snaffling the access card while the boss is busy blubbing. Smooth - 11 seconds in total.</p><p>He flexes some more muscle by popping a couple of earth leakage detectors as he passes by some equipment. The old high-powered-transmitter-inducing-current-in-the-leakage-wire trick.</p><p>His attempts at conquering the comms room in the same manner fail dismally, though. I operate under the assumption that anyone who should be playing with electricity knows the dangers and wouldn't need safeguards anyway...</p><p>It's the price you pay for being good. And who'd lose a whole network just to save the mind of someone who's playing with something they shouldn't?</p><p>Getting to the point, my counterpart speaks in crypted 'NetSpeak'.</p><p>&quot;What's that unit like?&quot; he asks, gesturing at the supplier.</p><p>&quot;A little 2400. No actually, this one's probably 300 synchronous. On a good day.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, it was transmitting nulls earlier&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Nothing a repeated Control-Alt-Delete wouldn't solve.&quot;</p><p>The boss returns in bandages for the free lunch. And over lunch, my counterpart and I talk turkey.</p><p>&quot;I favour the previous configuration,&quot; my rival states.</p><p>&quot;Yeah, a bit too much SNMP at the moment, but that's always been the case.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, me too. So ... a reinstall of the original specs...&quot;</p><p>Two weeks later the takeover threat is but a memory. I have a brand new Bean Counter department in the sights and am raring to go. Some of the upper middle management who favoured a protracted takeover as grounds for a pay rise took early retirement - the 40s are such a difficult time of life, especially when you find a photo of yourself in women's underwear (in the confines of a very progressive Soho club) in the top drawer of your desk.</p><p>I get a call from my counterpart on the secure line.</p><p>&quot;All clear?&quot; he asks.</p><p>&quot;Yep. You?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not a worry. Had to let your PFY go, you know how it is. A real pity.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not to worry, he's back at his desk, playing with the temperature of the fridge which is storing tomorrow's chicken lunches. I'll probably eat out...&quot;</p><p>The world is full of networking victories - this has been one of them.</p><hr noshade width=50%><h2 align=center>A brief Bastard Net Speak glossary ...</h2><ul><li>2400 - 2400 baud.</li><li>Slow300 synchronous - so slow he needs a tow-rope.</li><li>Previous Configuration - the way things were.</li><li>SNMP - stupidity of non-technical manager's proposals.</li><li>Transmitting Nulls - talking bollocks.</li><li>Repeated Control-Alt-Delete - lots of boots - a good kicking.</li></ul><hr noshade><p align=center>Previous : <a href="bofh1may.html">The BOFH averts a takeover ...</a><br>Next : <a href="bofh15may.html">The BOFH and the CEO's pet project ...</a></p><p align=center>Back to <a href="../index.html#New">The Bastard Menu</a>.</p></font></BODY></HTML>
