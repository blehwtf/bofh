Normally, I shove this to one side and if any of the paper pushers upstairs complain they get shown the door swiftly when the CEO receives insulting e-mail from their PCs. It's amazing the rude words the chair warmers can come up with sometimes.</p><p>But this time it's different. It's yearly budget time again, which means once more it's time to print the 'Basic Computing' OHPs so I can explain to the technical management committee why we should look at upgrading our network.</p><p>I briefly consider not printing the 'This is a BIT, This is a BYTE' slides, but reconsider when I remember that one of the committee avoids lace-up shoes because it takes him an hour longer to get ready for work...</p><p>While I'm planning the phone rings. Caller-ID tells me that it's a nasty specimen from Public Relations who just yesterday, as chance would have it, was lucky enough to slip into a parking space that I myself was about to enter.</p><p>Lucky is, of course, a relative term, and subject to revision over time. The time is now. I press the 'record conversation' button.</p><p>&quot;Hi, network ops,&quot; I say.</p><p>&quot;I need a PCMCIA net card for my laptop. By Friday, 9am.&quot;</p><p>Of course it's Thursday afternoon, 3:45pm.</p><p>&quot;Ah, equipment purchases must go through your department,&quot; I say.</p><p>&quot;Then you'll have to loan me one. The purchase order wouldn't go through in time. Besides, it's my personal machine, I've got a presentation to give to the CEO that I've been working on at home.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wouldn't it be preferable to transfer all this via back-up floppies to your work machine?&quot; I ask, praying for the desired response.</p><p>&quot;Don't be stupid, it'd take me a year to back this lot up. Just get me a card and I'll do the presentation from my laptop tomorrow.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, I've got a ... doctor's appointment right now so I won't have time to configure your machine for the card,&quot; I say, giving him the chance to dig a nice big hole. &quot;Also, I won't be in until about 9:30am tomorrow.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'll do the bloody configuration!&quot; he growls. &quot;It's not rocket science, despite what you geeks attempt to imply!&quot;</p><p>Hole dug nice and deep. Now to work on the edging details...</p><p>&quot;I don't know, if you get something wrong, or the card's incompatible..&quot;</p><p>&quot;IT'S A BLOODY PCMCIA CARD. HOW CAN IT BE INCOMPATIBLE!?!&quot;</p><p>The hole is perfection, in fact it looks almost grave-like.</p><p>&quot;Well, OK, I'll leave one in the equipment room. But take a network card and not a SECURE-network card. Do you know the difference?&quot;</p><p>He's in a lather now and there's no way he'd admit ignorance.</p><p>&quot;JUST LEAVE THE BLOODY CARD OUT AND I'LL PICK IT UP IN THE MORNING!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well OK..&quot;</p><p>He hangs up.</p><p>From the 'documentation' safe I pull out the 'special' PCMCIA card and pop it on the desk in the equipment room.</p><p>The next day I roll in at about 9:30 in time to be summoned to the CEO's office.</p><p>&quot;WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?&quot; he rants.</p><p>&quot;About what?&quot; I ask, innocence personified.</p><p>&quot;THAT BLOODY EXPLODING NETWORK CARD THAT CARSON IN PR. GOT!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Exploding network card? What explo.. Oh dear. He didn't try to install a SECURE-network card in his machine did he? I told him yesterday to be careful about installing and configuring it. They're programmed to self-destruct if someone attempts to override their access parameters...&quot;</p><p>&quot;By self-destruct you mean..?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well there's a tiny nitrate charge in them which burns out the circuitry..&quot;</p><p>&quot;Or perhaps blows a hole the size of a saucer through the laptop in question?&quot;</p><p>&quot;They DID have teething problems with the first batch, which is why I had them recalled to the equipment room in preparation to send them back to the manufacturer. But it shouldn't have been used in the first place. I warned Carson yesterday when he asked, it's all on the voice tapes...&quot;</p><p>Much later as I'm watching the name 'Carson, MJ' being removed from the floor directory and 'Carson, MJ' in person being removed from the premises, I can't help but wonder what makes people think they can beat the system.</p><p>It's a good system. It's MY system.</p><p>I like it.</p><p>Now, to complete plans for the budget meeting...</p><hr noshade><p align=center>Previous : <a href="bofh4oct.html">The BOFH is on a buying mission ...</a><br>Next : <a href="bofh18oct.html">The BOFH gets a new boss ...</a></p><p align=center>Back to <a href="../index.html#New">The Bastard Menu</a>.</p></font></BODY></HTML>
