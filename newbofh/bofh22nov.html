Doubly worrying - the official office grapevine (Sharon the ex-ex-boss's secretary) has it that the new boss is a Bean Counter!!!</p><p>A new boss is bad enough, as they all want to distinguish themselves by re-arranging the department hierarchy to transform it from a stunted money-soak into a glittering and applauded service division.</p><p>But a Bean Counter is bound to be much worse!</p><p>Bean Counters have a reputation for reshuffles that are worse than a half-blind, epileptic poker player in a disco.</p><p>To get to this position he must have:</p><ul><li>got the CEO completely suckered with his glittering dream, or</li><li>found out that while the interior decorating of the CEO's office cost the company tens of thousands of pounds, the redecorating of the CEO's entire home only cost 47p.</li></ul><p>Amazing what you find out when you throw a passive fax-receiver across the CEO's personal fax line ...</p><p>It's 9.15am on Monday morning, and the entire department waits with bated breath for the arrival of Gerry, the new commander in chief.</p><p>He emerges from the rear stairwell catching half the department lift-gazing - quite a change from the normal clock watching.</p><p>Straight away he calls a meeting to discuss his 'departmental economising'.</p><p>None of the staff really care, they've been moved around so much in the last couple of years that the walls are on wheels and the room directory is a blackboard. Not even X.500 can keep up.</p><p>The meeting trundles along with the usual nightmarish staff regroupings (PC support with the telephone operators; Unix operators with the tea lady , and so on).</p><p>Groups are renamed 'Knowledge Units', so everyone gets a warm feeling from the reshuffle shafting they just got.</p><p>The meeting takes a turn for the worse as the bifocals of death come to rest on me.</p><p>&quot;Simon, as network engineer, you will be invaluable in your position on the help desk. Your co-operation will ensure network fault resolution times drop dramatically ...&quot;</p><p>I don't think I need to mention that the chances of me accepting a position on the help desk are so slim that it would make an anorexic Ethiopian on a hunger strike look like Porky Pig.</p><p>On the way back to my office I realise that I can make the most of this by rising from the hell I've just been placed in, or by wasting my time in pointless revenge.</p><p>I let a coin decide by flipping it ...</p><p>Heads.</p><p>Revenge it is then.</p><p>A freak earthquake shocks the coin to 'Tails'.</p><p>Revenge it is then.</p><p>'Edge' was so close too.</p><p>The way is clear. Gerry has obviously spent a weekend formulating this and will shortly fire a salvo of memos both around the department and up to the Execs.</p><p>I dust off my Router Text-Change software (a simple piece of code that simply watches packets go by and occasionally introduces a spelling mistake or adds a zero to the end of a figure), make a few modifications and upload it to the network hardware. To be on the safe side, I upload the duplicator code as well.</p><p>Scant minutes later my workstation beeps as e-mail from the boss comes in. A memo confirming the decisions made at the meeting if I'm not mistaken. (Never am. Never was. Never will be.)</p><p>I don't need to open the message to know that the 'To:' line has been written with an inventive expletive sequence.</p><p>Two minutes later the phone rings. Caller ID returns: 'Big Guy'.</p><p>&quot;What the hell's going on with the system?&quot; The CEO growls.</p><p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; I ask, caring and concerned.</p><p>&quot;My printer's spewing the same memo over and over and I've been receiving repeated e-mail messages&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's not from Gerry is it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, why?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, he's probably been playing around with his printer and mail client settings again. I'll sort it out post haste.&quot;</p><p>The CEO hangs up, and I drop the router out, so solving the problem. Round One to me, I think.</p><p>I would ring the Boss, but he appears to be talking to the CEO about something quite pressing at the moment. Perhaps later ...</p><p align=center><strong>To be continued ...</strong></p><hr noshade><p align=center>Previous : <a href="bofh15nov.html">The BOFH and the engineer ...</a> Next : <a href="bofh29nov.html">The BOFH retaliates ...</a></p><p align=center>Back to <a href="../index.html#New">The Bastard Menu</a>.</p></font></BODY></HTML>
