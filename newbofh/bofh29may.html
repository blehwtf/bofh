Perhaps it's got something to do with me relocating the helpdesk to the recently-vacated Boss's office and accidentally putting an axe fifty-three times through the phone cables down that corridor. Forget using pink noise tapes for relaxation, there's nothing quite like the distant sound of phones being slammed frustratedly into cradles to help a BOFH chill out. Our telecomms system is in a shocking state; must be down to all the users taking out their anger on the handsets.</p><p>I make sure the door's closed and electrified appropriately (in case any of the braver users get the rash urge to come round in person), and settle down with my reading material.</p><p>Normally, this is the time to catch up on those Dutch magazines that were inadvertently delivered to the back door a couple of months ago - and which seem to have been delivered equally inadvertently ever since. You wouldn't believe that the same mistake could be made again and again, would you? Someone, though, seems to have found my private stash, since it appears to have grown legs. I suspect it's my PFY, as he's been walking around recently with a knowing smile on his face. He'll soon learn the perils of being nosey when I've figured out just what do do with the electric stapler, though. Anyway, in the meantime, I'm stuck with reading networking magazines.</p><p>Pausing only to fill in a 'please send a barmy UPS salesman to see me' form in the name of the guy from accounts who cut me up in the car park this morning, I start to wade through the surprisingly tall stack of unopened networking mags. One item catches my eye, though: the Networking Professional of the Year award. I laugh inwardly - it'll probably be won by some sad anorak who spends his weekends up to his ears in UTP, spends his evenings retrieving lost files from users' PCs, and who earns crap wages and no gratitude. I read on, however : &quot;... presented at a special ceremony at l'Hotel Ambassadeur in the south of France&quot;</p><p>Ah, now, let's not be too hasty. There is, naturally, a lot to be said for the unsung heroes of the networking world. At least that's the line I'll use when I try to persuade the CEO to let me enter the competition.</p><p>Up in the CEO's office, the man himself stares at me glassy-eyed for about a minute. The words finally emerge in a croak. &quot;YOU want to put in for the Network Professional of the Year?&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's right. Just think of the credit I'd bring to the company&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm thinking of the bad publicity you'd bring to the company&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's not very nice!&quot; I adopt my most aggrieved expression, combined with my most innocent tone of voice. &quot;And after all I've done for this company, too&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don't you mean '_TO_ this company'?&quot; The CEO looks at me and starts reading from the entry form. &quot;Helpful to his/her superiors? You've gone through five bosses in the last year!&quot;</p><p>&quot;So I've had to cope with five different working methods - it's a much more demanding part to play. I think it demonstrates great flexibility.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But you're responsible for all of them leaving!!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Coincidence... they all seem to remember another job offer somewhere else. Perhaps you ought to look at your working conditions and salaries&quot;, I suggest slyly.</p><p>&quot;Perhaps I ought to consider whether I need as many support staff as I do&quot;</p><p>Ouch. That was a little below the belt. Oh well ...</p><p>&quot;Perhaps the Inland Revenue might find out about the secret account that was mysteriously set up on a computer outside the main system.&quot;</p><p>The CEO reddens and suddenly seems to find his blotter fascinating. He recovers slightly and reads on from my form.</p><p>&quot;And what about this,&quot; the CEO is almost shouting now. &quot;A good team player&quot;?</p><p>&quot;Yes. Naturally I'd expect my pimply faced assistant to be included in the entry. As a good team player, I'd expect members of the team to be included.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But he's a psychopath!&quot;</p><p>&quot;So? Are you going to hold that against him? It's not very supportive of you. I personally think the climate in the south of France will do wonders for his temperament and the experience of going to such an event will do wonders for his social skills.&quot;</p><p>&quot;There'll be a diplomatic incident!&quot;</p><p>The CEO carries on reading. &quot;Nominations for the awards must be accompanied by three signed endorsements by the nominee's colleagues.&quot; He paused; &quot;There's no-one here who would agree to sign such a statement. They all hate you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;So I can enter the award if I can get the form signed?&quot;</p><p>&quot;If you can find three of our employees who will sign it, you can enter. But I'm only saying that because I know nobody here will sign it&quot;. He exits, laughing silently to himself.</p><p>A miracle, eh? Nothing's impossible in the world of networking, as I never tire of telling users whose hard disks have been miraculously wiped clean. After all, who said getting someone's signature on a form actually needed them to write it ...</p><p><strong>To be continued ...</strong></p><hr noshade><p align=center>Previous : <a href="bofh22may.html">The BOFH and the PFY's raise ...</a><br>Next : <a href="bofh5jun.html">The BOFH wins the day in France ...</a></p><p align=center>Back to <a href="../index.html#New">The Bastard Menu</a>.</p></font></BODY></HTML>
