Deciding to plan the cabling of a set of refurbished offices single handedly was his second foolish move.</p><p>&quot;Well, it's a bit of a tricky one,&quot; says my supplier down the phone.</p><p>&quot;You see, I have the cable you want - in fact, I have about twice what you'll need - but it's already been purchased and is going to be delivered today. Have you tried another supplier?&quot;</p><p>Smooth as greased silk ...</p><p>&quot;Yeah, but unfortunately they're all out of Cat 5 too,&quot; I reply.</p><p>&quot;You're joking!&quot; he gasps, convincingly.</p><p>&quot;Yep, it's as if someone has ordered up the entire cable market in one gulp - everyone's sold out for the next couple of days. Are you sure there's nothing you can do?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, not really - about all I've got left is a stack of that untested stuff that we got dirt cheap. It looks like Cat 5, but it's got some foreign military spec on it which doesn't equate to any known rating.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We'll take it! Get it here by lunchtime!&quot; the boss shouts.</p><p>&quot;Hang on a minute there,&quot; I say, sneakily flipping on the voice recorder. &quot;Wouldn't it be better to find out what the spec is - it could be field-phone cable for all we know.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We haven't got time, I've committed to having the new offices up and running in three days!&quot; the boss cries, then dashes off to confirm the attendance of our cabling contractors.</p><p>I switch the voice recorder off.</p><p>&quot;So, what are we getting?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&quot;Not really sure. It was salvaged from a sunken Romanian container - I only bought it for the copper value.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And will it carry signal?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh yes&quot;</p><p>&quot;Really?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, maybe - unshielded, untwisted - I'd think twice about using it for Christmas tree lights myself, but there you go.&quot;</p><p>&quot;So why did you say it looked like Cat 5?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&quot;Well, the sheathing is similar, and it comes on a drum,&quot; he replies.</p><p>&quot;And all ours comes on easy-flow cartons?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I didn't say it looked exactly like Cat 5!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Excellent!&quot; I chuckle. &quot;Talk to you later.&quot;</p><p>Later that afternoon, I'm interrupted by the boss in an agitated mood.</p><p>&quot;That bloody cable is crap!&quot; he cries.</p><p>&quot;Well, I did warn you not to purchase it,&quot; I mention, indicating the voice-recording lamp on my phone. &quot;Which reminds me, I must get that bulb fixed.&quot;</p><p>The boss is now trapped; he has no cable, a deadline, and four or five cabling contractors kicking around in the lobby at a reasonably hefty hourly rate. And he's just paid good money for crap cable.</p><p>Being a benevolent sort, I decide to help the boss out. I call Raoul.</p><p>&quot;Raoul, what would we be paying for some Cat 5 cable?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&quot;I've already told you that we don't have any c...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sorry, let me re-phrase that, what would we be paying for someone else's Cat 5 cable?&quot;</p><p>The boss's eyes light up as a solution presents itself. Raoul mentions some disgusting figure which the boss nods at rapidly.</p><p>&quot;But our delivery van has been stolen,&quot; Raoul adds, according to plan. &quot;You could pick it up from here though.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No can do,&quot; I reply, &quot;my car's a two seater.&quot;</p><p>&quot;TAKE MINE!&quot; the boss cries, mental clock ticking.</p><p>Half an hour later, the pimply-faced-youth and I are loading cartons of cable into the back of the boss's palace on wheels. I decide to drive back now that the PFY has admitted he's actually only had two driving lessons.</p><p>Still, I'm sure all the dents (except for the ones left by the three parking meters) will hammer out eventually.</p><p>I bid Raoul goodbye and ask him to cancel the mass of Cat 5 orders I placed that caused the artificial shortage of the last two days.</p><p>Back at the office, the boss is so pleased he doesn't even mention the remains of his radiator left by the PFY's parking meter interlude. He sends the cabling contractors over.</p><p>&quot;Right ...,&quot; I say, &quot;... your cable's on the drum over there.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That stuff?&quot; one of them asks. &quot;Isn't that Romanian writing?&quot; Ten minutes later Raoul is making me an offer on some excess Cat 5 that I just cannot refuse...</p><hr noshade><p align=center>Previous : <a href="bofh16oct.html">Beancounter central takes vehement action ...</a><br>Next : <a href="bofh30oct.html">Don't let the Boss set up a network ...</a></p><p align=center>Back to <a href="../index.html#New">The Bastard Menu</a>.</p></font></BODY></HTML>
