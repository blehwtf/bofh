True, that's not such a rare occurrence, but today I'm VERY unhappy.</p><p>The boss has just dropped a bombshell in that he has single-handedly negotiated a bulk deal maintenance contract from one of our hardware suppliers entitling us to a 50 per cent discount on the maintenance of a machine.</p><p>Now I'm as much in favour of maintenance discounts as the next Systems and Networks Administrator who believes that most maintenance engineers should be struck about the head with a rugby sock full of thin-wire terminators, but this sounds a tad suspicious.</p><p>The boss, well known for having problems negotiating hallways, has somehow managed to cheat the highly skilled, money- grabbing, shafting professionals that make up the maintenance sales team at 'Rob-me-blind' Corp.</p><p>Uh-huh.</p><p>And while he was at it, he found his office without asking for help.</p><p>I don't think so.</p><p>So all that remains is for me to see what sort of complete pants-downer we've got.</p><p>&quot;So what sort of contract is it?&quot; I ask him, once he's back in his office gloating.</p><p>&quot;Standard contract as before, only I've got the bastards LOCKED INTO IT for 20 years!&quot; he cries gleefully. &quot;IT'S AIRTIGHT! I had their lawyer squirming!&quot;</p><p>&quot;And OUR lawyer?&quot; I ask, expecting the inevitable. &quot;Overrated!&quot; he replies. &quot;Could have done it with my eyes closed&quot;</p><p>Looking over the contract, I see he probably did.</p><p>&quot;Mmm. One small question,&quot; I say, teeing up for a long drive down the fairway of hopelessness.</p><p>&quot;Yes?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You do realise that WE are also locked into this deal for 20 years?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, bearing that in mind, could you point me to any - ANY piece of equipment we've had for more than five years, let alone 20?&quot;</p><p>A penny starts the long drop.</p><p>&quot;Uh...Ummmm...well...nothing?!?&quot; he squeaks as his penny investment policy matures.</p><p>&quot;Not quite true,&quot; I say. &quot;We do have the large IBM card punching machine in the computer room. And do you know why we have it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;To punch cards?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not when we don't have the corresponding reader...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Air conditioner ballast!&quot; he blurts, just guessing.</p><p>&quot;No. True, switching it off would relieve the necessity for a couple of the larger aircons, but no. The reason we have it is because it was put in when the building was first commissioned. It's not even ours. It's worth about &#163;200 as scrap, only we can't collect BECAUSE IT'S TOO BIG TO GET OUT THE BLOODY DOOR!&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don't get the point,&quot; the boss confesses.</p><p>I check the document to make sure.</p><p>&quot;Well, you have signed, a BINDING, AIRTIGHT contract which says that we will pay them &#163;2,000 a month, every month, for the next 20 years, to look after a minicomputer that in about five years' time won't even put up a good show against a pocket calculator. And you didn't ask to see their licence beforehand?!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Which licence?&quot;</p><p>&quot;THEIR BLOODY LICENCE TO PRINT MONEY! YOU'VE GIVEN THEM EVERYTHING! THE ONLY THING YOU MISSED OUT WAS AN ACCIDENT INDEMNITY CLAUSE!&quot; I shout in a frenzy.</p><p>An ice cold thought hits me. &quot;You didn't give them complete indemnity against damage, did you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; our skilled arbitration professional asks.</p><p>&quot;Complete indemnity against damage. You know, they trip on a floor tile and drop their screwdriver down a ventilation hole and short the power supply to the backplane and blow a machine to bits. Their responsibility ends with 'SORRY'.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Uhhhhmmmmm... No. No, in fact I'm sure I didn't because once an engineer snapped the lead in my propelling pencil and we made him pay!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, well at &#163;2,000 a month, I'm sure the cost of a pencil lead will have them insuring themselves to the hilt.&quot;</p><p>Two weeks later the engineer from Rob-us-Blind-for-20-years arrives.</p><p>To make us feel like he's earning his dosh he unscrews the cover, gives the diagnostic lights a look, writes down a couple of numbers, then smiling smugly, puts the cover back on.</p><p>In fact he's so smug he doesn't even notice the PFY snaffling one of his screwdrivers and wandering off.</p><p>Nor does he notice the floor tile which is sitting a little higher than the others. Until he trips on it, tool-kit bursting on impact (as planned) followed by an extremely loud 'BANG' as our priceless, museum piece, very first company card punch machine explodes with his screwdriver between the power supply and the wiring loom.</p><p>Being an old machine it catches fire as well. Or that could be the petrol-soaked rag the PFY and I stuffed it with beforehand.</p><p>The boss and one of our lawyers gaze soundlessly from behind the viewing screen, the lawyer contemplating damages, the boss contemplating the humungous favour he'll owe me at contract renegotiation time...</p><hr noshade><p align=center>Previous : <a href="bofh3jul.html">The BOFH has heated exchange with the boss ...</a><br>Next : <a href="bofh17jul.html">The BOFH explains, dummies don't grow on trees ...</a></p><p align=center>Back to <a href="../index.html#New">The Bastard Menu</a>.</p></font></BODY></HTML>
