Not satisfied with having the run of the machine room in almost the same manner as the PFY and I reign the comms room, the pricks have now stuffed up our purchasing system as well.</p><p>Now, instead of identifying a piece of equipment that's smoked its last and shoving a well-stacked replacement purchase order under the boss's nose for his 'X' of approval, we have to e-mail all purchase requests for any computing products to the systems purchases software for the systems geeks to peruse, approve and source a competitively priced alternative to...</p><p>I'm fit to be tied. The PFY is chainable. Perhaps it's because we received a 'Crisco' brand switch instead of the 'Cisco' one we ordered - straight from Silicon Back-Alley in Venezuela. Judging by its face value the country should have stopped exports at the Miss World Competitor mark. I blame myself for the personal note to our product-of-choice sales rep of &quot;plus all the fruit for 100base-T x20&quot; which appears to have been interpreted literally. At least the cafeteria won't be short of bananas for a year or two.</p><p>I confront the boss as soon as possible.</p><p>&quot;We can't accept delivery of that,&quot; I cry. &quot;The voltage supply settings only have two options: 12 and 24.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It's obviously a switch printing error,&quot; he says. &quot;They left the zero off the end.&quot;</p><p>As I confront one of the purchasing system's operators with the smoking remains of the aforementioned piece of crap, the boss says defensively: &quot;Well, we can't send it back now! After all, the switch did say 12v and 24v... We'll have to get it fixed! And anyway, you didn't specify that you wanted a 240 volt AC device when you sent your order through to the purchasing system.</p><p>They're not mind-readers you know.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, but then I didn't say 'avoid buying thinwire cabling with it' either, did I?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, the thinwire cabling's still in the basement,&quot; the purchasing geek interrupts, &quot;Actually, we made a killing on Crisco's winter special - 'thickwire-for-thin'.&quot;</p><p>&quot;See?&quot; the boss says &quot;We're saving money already.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You bought 4,000 metres of thickwire cabling for office wiring?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yep, and it was dirt cheap,&quot; he beams.</p><p>In an extraordinary change of character, I take a sick day because I really am feeling ill. The next day, when I tell the PFY, he does too. The following day, we're back at work and determined to make a go of it. I show the boss some thickwire, cabling duct and a large diameter masonry drill.</p><p>&quot;Where do we start?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&quot;Umm,&quot; the boss mumbles, knowing his popularity will be inversely proportional to the noise of the drill slowly whining from one side of the building to the other. &quot;Perhaps we should send the cable back then.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Perhaps we should,&quot; I reply.</p><p>&quot;Can't do it,&quot; the purchasing geek says. &quot;We have to pay a restocking fee and the system's not set up for that.&quot;</p><p>Right. It's war.</p><p>I write a script to order 20 floppy disks, one at a time. I also set my e-mail return address to the in-mail address of the Purchasing System.</p><p>Five minutes later, when the system runs out of memory, the PFY and I have an impromptu meeting with the boss and systems geeks.</p><p>&quot;He ran our server out of memory and crashed it!&quot; the combined geeks whine.</p><p>&quot;Ran it out of memory?&quot; Clickety-click. &quot;There, I've ordered you some more... uh-oh, looks like it's crashed again. You must be really low. Tell you what, as soon as it comes up I'll re-order some more, just to be safe...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don't!&quot; the boss snaps.</p><p>&quot;But we have to put it through the purchasing system,&quot; I say.</p><p>&quot;OK,&quot; the boss sighs. &quot;Put it through in writing to the systems people and they'll enter it into the system themselves.&quot;</p><p>The PFY chirps up: &quot;But they'll just miss out or abbreviate bits they think are irrelevant and we'll end up with another non-brand piece of crap!&quot;</p><p>&quot;No. They will enter it word for word as you request,&quot; the boss decrees. &quot;Is that understood?&quot;</p><p>The systems geeks nod, and the PFY and I grudgingly concur.</p><p>As soon as they're gone I get the PFY to write out a new switch order.</p><p>&quot;What should I put, 240 Volt AC 20 port UTP Switch...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Put whatever you like, just make sure it goes past 256 characters because that's the limit of their description field.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's a little childish.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not as childish as writing, 'A dickhead is typing this in', in the description field of an order.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You wouldn't!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Did. Will do again, and planning on documenting it for the rest of the department. Any questions?&quot;</p><p>&quot;None whatsoever.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Right, then get scribbling. And make it as illegible as possible.&quot;</p><hr noshade><p align=center>Previous : <a href="bofh26nov97.html">While the Bastard's away ...</a><br>Next : <a href="bofh10dec97.html">The BOFH in the season of Good Will ...</a></p><p align=center>Back to <a href="../index.html#New97">The Bastard Menu</a>.</p></font></BODY></HTML>
