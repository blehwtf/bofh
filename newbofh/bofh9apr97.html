It looks as if a career change could be in the wind. I get summoned into the boss's office to answer a complaint about my 'attitude'...</p><p>To make things 'fair' the Boss arranges for the head of personnel (his friend and my mortal opponent), to attend as a witness. Although I have, on occasion, had the odd difference of opinion with him, I depend on his professionalism. I'm sure he really just wants to bury the hatchet, which is why I'll make a point of not turning my back...</p><p>&quot;Simon,&quot; the Boss begins, &quot;we have a formal complaint about you from one of the new system programmers. He claims that you are being unnecessarily offensive to him.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm afraid I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He claims that you told him to do something with your faeces.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I beg your pardon?&quot; I reply, shocked. &quot;There must be some mistake. The last time I spoke to him I told him that I had a system crash core that I'd like him to examine. I cannot possibly be held responsible for the strange way in which he interpreted that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You were leaving the toilet at the time.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Purely coincidental. I simply mentioned it when the opportunity arose.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Mentioned? It was more of a shout wasn't it? I believe I heard it myself from in here.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I concede that it may have been slightly more than a whisper, but that was only because of the deference that I feel for his wealth of professional knowledge...&quot; (Well, it was worth a shot).</p><p>&quot;The words 'sniff my dump' do not engender in MY mind a feeling of professional respect.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well of course I'm completely apologetic if this has caused a major department disruption - I'll go and apologise immediately!&quot;</p><p>&quot;You know as well as I do that he's resigned.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not at all. How did this come about?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It appears that he is a little disconcerted with the frequency of explosions of his peripheral equipment.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Really? Perhaps there's something wrong with his UPS system again. There's been a bit of that going around recently...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, I noticed the IT divisional accountant has resigned, siting workplace stress as a reason.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, I blame the makers of the equipment,&quot; I reply. &quot;In the old days things were much more tolerant of slight faults.&quot;</p><p>&quot;By slight faults you mean the odd 400-volt supply spike that the electricians can find no excuse for?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Really? I wouldn't know. Someone has stolen my multimeter.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You mean the multimeter set to the 10-amp scale and plugged across a mains device in the boardroom so that the circuit breaker for the floor blew every time the overhead projector was switched on?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Really? Who would do a thing like that?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Any reason why security found your fingerprints all over the machine?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I have to check a lot of floppies in my job.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I see. Well, it's out of my hands now anyway. The CEO wants to speak to you personally.&quot;Personal interviews are rare in the company, and quite often precede a 'resignation'.</p><p>The Boss and I get the nod to go in...</p><p>&quot;What's this about all these problems downstairs?&quot; the CEO barks.</p><p>&quot;Would you like the technical answer or just layman's terms?&quot; I ask, respectfully.</p><p>&quot;Layman's terms will do for a start.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Myself and my trainee are the only people in the company who really do know what we're doing.&quot;</p><p>The Boss shakes his head, smiling humourlessly.</p><p>&quot;Yes, I'd heard that was the case,&quot; the CEO replies, having been primed during extended family get-togethers by the PFY. Oh, the beauty of an insider...</p><p>&quot;Ah excuse me!&quot; The Boss blurts anxiously. &quot;But I believe you're overlooking something here.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course I am.&quot; The CEO smiles benevolently. &quot;We are, of course, sorry to see you go.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What? I'm not bloody resigning, and there's no way you'll get me to sign it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But you already have,&quot; the CEO replies, confused, holding up a piece of paper with the Boss's freshly scrawled signature on it. &quot;But who could possibly replace me?&quot; the Boss burbles.</p><p>&quot;You're looking at him,&quot; the CEO smiles.</p><p>&quot;You're going to take over Networks?!&quot; the Boss cries.</p><p>&quot;No...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then wh...&quot; Disbelief and horror fight a little war for supremacy on his twitching face. &quot;You can't be serious!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course he is,&quot; I respond quickly. &quot;Now, I hear you're looking for a job and it just so happens that there's a vacancy in our network operations section. You'll be reporting to me, of course...&quot;</p><p>You know sometimes life can be a bastard, but when it's good, it's REALLY good.</p><hr noshade><p align=center>Previous : <a href="bofh2apr97.html">The B.O.F.H. wins an award from his peer group ...</a><br>Next : <a href="bofh16apr97.html">The Bastard puts his newest protege through a rather nasty baptism ...</a></p><p align=center>Back to <a href="../index.html#New97">The Bastard Menu</a>.</p></font></BODY></HTML>
