Normally this would have me smiling at the thought of spending more company dosh, but we don't have the bandwidth to support the system company-wide.</p><p>&quot;Why?&quot; the PFY asks, smelling a rodent-like creature.</p><p>&quot;Ah. Well, I'd been meaning to tell you about that...&quot;</p><p>&quot;You've sold our bandwidth to a third party haven't you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not exactly, no.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You've cranked up the company's ISP service?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, I sold that off ages ago.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You sold it off!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yup, cashed in the client base and ISP domain name to another supplier. Very lucrative.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And didn't pay me off?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nope. I didn't even pay me off.&quot;</p><p>&quot;So what did you do with the dosh?&quot;</p><p>&quot;What did I do with the 'venture capital' you mean?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Come again?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Suffice to say that we are the sole partners in InterTelecom Internationale, supplier of cheap telephone calls to the world...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Uh?&quot;</p><p>&quot;And our latest client is a company with offices all over the world. One of which you are standing in.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You're selling our bandwidth back to the company? Why the hell did they buy it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, if you remember the time of the big falling out of beancounters and networks...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Which one?&quot;</p><p>&quot;The one where the head of accounts said that our overheads for providing international calls were too high and that we'd be better off going through a public supplier.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ah yes, but I thought you'd engineered that because you had some master plan...&quot;</p><p>&quot;So I did. And you'll be pleased to know that InterTelecom Internationale outbid all the other companies by virtue of its low operating overheads.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Meaning we're stealing bandwidth from the company!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Stealing's such an ugly word. We're simply maintaining one hundred per cent usage of the existing links - something the company should be rewarding us for. And they are, every time we collect our bonuses through InterTelecom Internationale.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sneaky,&quot; the PFY grudgingly admits. &quot;So what's the problem?&quot;</p><p>&quot;If we whack in this conferencing stuff we're bound to get congestion problems.&quot;</p><p>&quot;True, but we know it's a toy and not going to be used all that often after the first time.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I expect so,&quot; I reply.</p><p>&quot;Then I have a plan...&quot;</p><p>A week later some very expensive kit is brought into the company under the boss's vigilant eye. The PFY has gone to our US office for the testing, and a part-time contractor is to do the same in Rome.</p><p>The testing is completed just as the CEO wanders down and electronically greets the PFY and part-timer. Response is good, and the boss and CEO seem fairly pleased with themselves.</p><p>&quot;Now I'd like to speak to the rest of the offices please,&quot; he says.</p><p>Over in the comms room, the telephone exchange suddenly pops a circuit breaker and goes down.</p><p>The offices concerned are switched into the picture - and very grainily if I say so myself. The assembled staff listen as the CEO gives a short speech about the wonders of technology. A few comments pass back and forth before the CEO 'rings off'.</p><p>&quot;What did you think sir?&quot; the boss asks.</p><p>&quot;Well, the testing bit was OK, but the office response wasn't so good.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes,&quot; I admit &quot;it's a problem with Heisenberg's certainty principle of video compression.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You what?&quot; the boss gags.</p><p>&quot;Heisenberg's certainty principle of video compression. It's a famous quantum physics experiment which videoed cats in boxes. The more cats, the more certainty that you'll get quantum disturbance in video compression.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That rings a bell for some reason,&quot; the boss blunders.</p><p>&quot;How do we fix it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;The only way is to eliminate the compression, which would require larger telecomms links...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Make it so,&quot; the CEO says, having watched far too much Star Trek during office hours.</p><p>The boss signs a couple of orders there and then and shuffles the CEO out.</p><p>I go next door and show the PFY and part-timer the orders while I reset the breaker on the exchange.</p><p>&quot;Shall I call the telecomms providers now?&quot; the PFY asks.</p><p>&quot;Yes, and tell them InterTelecom Internationale wishes to expand...&quot;</p><p>Fish. Barrel. Shotgun.</p><p>What could be easier...</p><hr noshade><p align=center>Previous : <a href="bofh8oct97.html">The PFY shows compassion to a user ...</a><br>Next : <a href="bofh22oct97.html">The scent of restructuring is in the air ...</a></p><p align=center>Back to <a href="../index.html#New97">The Bastard Menu</a>.</p></font></BODY></HTML>
