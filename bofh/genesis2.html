This guy's going to be a technical engineer, the sort that comes in with a raggedy tie where he got it caught in the drum printer at 3000 rpm a couple of years ago, and he'll have the grazes on the face that indicate that he didn't get the gate open in time...</p><p>I know those sorts...</p><p>So I fill in a couple of hours by killing users off and deleting their files, then waiting for them to call...</p><p>&quot;Um, I can't find my files&quot; the wimpering simp on the phone says</p><p>&quot;Files?

We don't make the files you know, we just look after them. And chopitty-chop too, your thesis looks like it's due in a couple of days..&quot;</p><p>I hang up - he'll call back. Meantime I open up a copy of &quot;VMS BASTARD OPERATORS MANUAL FROM HELL&quot; I'm reading the article I sent in about getting rid of those trouble users...</p></font><BLOCKQUOTE><I><p>&quot;... Modify the user's password minimum from 6 to 32 letters, give the password a 1 day lifetime, set it so that they HAVE to use the password generate utility when they change their password (so their password will always be something that looks like vaguely pronouncable line-noise), add a secondary password with the same as the above, then redefine their CLI tables so that the only command that works is DELETE, and all other commands point to it.&quot;</p></I></BLOCKQUOTE><font face=Verdana><p>Beautiful....
