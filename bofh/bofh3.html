The queue's WAAAAAY too long to have everything printed (and sorted) by the time I told them, so I kill all the small jobs so there's only 2 left and I can sort them in no time.</p><p>Then, after the movie, (which was one of those slack Bertolucci ones that takes about 3 hours till the main character is killed off in a visionary experience) I get back and clear the printouts.</p><p>There's about 50 people waiting outside and I've got two printouts. That's about average for me. I thought I'd killed more tho. Anyway, I put out the printouts and walk slooowly inside, fingering the clipboard with &quot;ACCOUNTS TO REMOVE&quot; in big letters on the back. No-one says anything. As usual.</p><p>. . .</p><p>I'm sitting back in the Operations Armchair, watching the computer room closed circuit TV, which just happens to be connected to the frame-grabber's Video player (sent off for repair, due back sometime in '97) when the phone rings. That must be the 2nd time today, and it's really starting to get to me!</p><p>&quot;Yes?&quot; I say, pausing the picture.</p><p>&quot;I seem to have accidentally deleted my C.V!&quot; the voice at the other end of the line says.</p><p>&quot;You have? What was your username?&quot;</p><p>He tells me. What the hell, I AM bored.</p><p>&quot;Ah no, you didn't delete it - I did.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I deleted it. It was full of shit! You didn't ever get more than a B- in any of your subjects!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p><p>&quot;And that crap about being a foreign exchange student, that was your girlfriend and we both know it!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh?!!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Your academic records. I checked them, you were lying.. Besides which, you forgot to include your criminal record..&quot;</p><p>&quot;How did y..&quot; He clicks. &quot;It's you isn't it? THE BASTARD OPERATOR FROM HELL!&quot;</p><p>&quot;In the flesh, on the phone and in your account.... You shouldn't have called you know. You especially shouldn't have given me your username..&quot; &gt;clickety&lt; &gt;click&lt; &quot;Neither should you have sent that mail to the System Manager telling him what you think of him in such graphic terms...&quot;</p><p>&quot;I didn't send any..&quot;</p><p>&gt;clickety&lt; &gt;click&lt;......</p><p>&quot;No, you didn't did you? But who can tell these days? Not to worry though, It'll all be over VERY soon..&quot; &gt;clickedy click&lt; &quot;..change my username back, and...&quot;</p><p>&quot;b-b-b..&quot; he blubs, like a stood-up date</p><p>&quot;Goodbye now&quot; I say pleasantly, &quot;you've got bags to pack and a life to start over...&quot;</p><p>I hang up.</p><p>Two seconds later the red phone goes. I pick it up, it's the boss. He mumbles the username of the person I was just talking to, mentions something about a nasty mail message, and utters the words &quot;You know what to do...&quot;, with the dots and everything.</p><p>Later, inside the Municipal Energy Authority Computer, as I'm modifying the poor pleb's Energy Bill by several zeros, I can't help but think about what lapse of judgement - what act of heinous stupidity - causes them to call. Then, even later, when I'm adding the poor pleb's photo image over the top of the FBI's online &quot;MOST Wanted Armed and Dangerous, SHOOT ON SIGHT&quot; offenders list, I realise I'll probably never know; but then life goes on.</p><p>A couple of hours later, as I see the SWAT vehicle roll up outside the poor pleb's apartment I realise that for some, it just doesn't.</p><p>But tommorrow is another day.</p><hr noshade><p align=center>Previous : <a href="bofh2.html">BOFH #2</a><br>  Next : <a href="bofh4.html">BOFH #4</a></p><p align=center>Back to <a href="../index.html#Original">The Bastard Menu</a>.</p></font></BODY></HTML>
