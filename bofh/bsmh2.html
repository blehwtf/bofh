And as the Immediate Past Bastard Operator from Hell, I have even higher standards.</p><p>I get the first applicant in.</p><p>&quot;Ok&quot; I say &quot;I'm just going to ask you some simple questions to guage your knowledge of Computing and Networking in relation to the Operations Field&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sure&quot;</p><p>&quot;Right. Question One. What's the best way to stop an individual posting nasty articles to news?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Close their account&quot;</p><p>&quot;Good - But can you elaborate?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Delete all their files, Change their password to `Knobhead' and Erase any backups of their account&quot;</p><p>&quot;Excellent. What is a killfile?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Uh. It's a list of usernames/topics/news items etc that you wish the news- reader to automatically skip so you don't have to wade through rubbish&quot;</p><p>&quot;Uh No. Remember I said pertaining to Operations. A killfile is in fact a file with a list of names of people you are going to kill.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh. Of course.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Never mind. What is DCE?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Delete, Close and Erase&quot;</p><p>&quot;Good. DTR?&quot;</p><p>&quot;DON'T TRY to RING. The Operator's watchword&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well done. DBMS?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Dont Bug My Supervisor. Probably the most important acronym around&quot;</p><p>&quot;You betcha. Ok. A user comes to you with a complaint about another user sending sexually explicit email messages to them. What do you do?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Take a copy of the messages, close the complainant's account (by accident) and extort money from the mailer by threatening to show their parents&quot;</p><p>&quot;Good. I think you'll do nicely. Hang onto this wire...&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don't think so.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Excellent. You passed the final test. You start tommorrow. Please leave by that door so as not to disturb the other applicants.&quot;</p><p>BZZZZZEEEERETTT!</p><p>Electrified Door Handle. Gets them every time. I think it's the &quot;Complaints Dept&quot; sign that draws them to it like moths to a globe...</p><p>I push the body out onto the fire escape.</p><p>&quot;NEXT!&quot;</p><hr noshade><p align=center>Previous : <a href="bsmh1.html">The Bastard System Manager From   Hell #1</a><br>Next : <a href="bofh14.html">BOFH #14</a></p><p align=center>Back to <a href="../index.html#Original">The Bastard Menu</a>.</p></font></BODY></HTML>
