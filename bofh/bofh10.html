Hmmm. This is a toughy really. You mean stuff like reading the email between you and your counsellor about you not wanting to come out of the closet?&quot;</p><p>&quot;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGH!&quot;</p><p>&quot;AH! Well, he seems to have left - must have picked a bad COMPLETELY RANDOM example. Next question. You, over there...&quot;</p><p>&quot;CMS1136. I was..&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ah yes, 1136 the only person on campus who subscribes to alt.sex.buggery.by.sailors.dressed.in.mums.clothing&quot;</p><p>&quot;It's purely for research purposes!&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm sure it is. You do a lot of story posting for a researcher don't you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;NNGggggAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGHGH!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Next please...&quot;</p><p>...</p><p>..</p><p>Two minutes later, the lecture theatre's empty. That's the problem with students today, they just don't want to learn.</p><p>I go back to control and Sam's asleep at the console again. I think he's after my job. I make a mental note to tap into the salary database and cancel his health and accident insurance payments. You can't be too careful..</p><p>I put the phone on the hook for the first time this afternoon and it starts ringing almost immediately. THAT'S IT! I redirect it to 911 catch a bit of shuteye. That'll teach them. OOPS! Almost forgot to turn over the excuse calendar. &quot;STATIC FROM NYLON UNDERWEAR&quot; Nope, too plausable - although in some cases I could do an on-site check. Nah, can't be stuffed. I'll pick another one. &quot;STATIC FROM PLASTIC SLIDE RULES&quot; Now THAT'S one with a challenge!</p><p>I un-redirect the phone and drag the rubbish bin so it rests on the printer's stacker - another job well done. The phone rings - this could be the big one!</p><p>&quot;Hello?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hi, Um, how do I spell-check my file?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Simple, just type `spell' and the filename&quot;</p><p>&quot;Thanks&quot;</p><p>I'm so bloody nice this morning. Especially as I know that my version of spell INTRODUCES errors instead of detecting them. Things like changing friend to freind and vice-versa. What the hell.</p><p>The phone rings - it's them again.</p><p>&quot;There's something wrong with spell&quot;</p><p>&quot;What makes you think that?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Because my file is all corrupt now!&quot;</p><p>&quot;That doesn't sound like spell to me. Are you logged into thru PC?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, but I can..&quot;</p><p>&quot;Please, leave the technical diagnosis to me... Now, is there a plastic ruler somewhere on or in the desk?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Um &gt;clunka&lt;, yes...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Right. You've got a static buildup on your hard-drive caused by the changing electrostatic field generated by the ruler - the same thing that makes bits of paper stick to it when you rub it up and down your arm...&quot;</p><p>DUMMY MODE ON</p><p>&quot;Oh. What do I do?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You know how you get paper off a ruler by hitting it on a table lots of times? Well do that with your PC. Say 20 times - lift it about a foot off the desk &amp; drop it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh. OK&quot;</p><p>&gt;crash&lt;</p><p>&gt;crash&lt;</p><p>&gt;crash&lt;</p><p>&quot;Um, the screen went dark&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's ok, it's supposed to do that - keep going. And when you're finished, do the screen as well, that static may have gone up the wires to it.&quot;</p><p>&gt;crash&lt;</p><p>&gt;crash&lt;</p><p>&gt;crash&lt;...</p><p>I hang up. I get up and go out to the public area to put honey in the floppy drives when a guy who looked like Lee Harvey Oswald runs up to me and shoots me, only the sound comes from the machine room, and I can hear the ex System-Managers chuckle....</p><p>Later, in the ambulance, I realise. I forgot to get the guys username...</p><p>Then everything goes dark</p><hr noshade><p align=center>Previous : <a href="bofh9.html">BOFH #9</a> Next : <a href="bofh11.html">BOFH   #11</a></p><p align=center>Back to <a href="../index.html#Original">The Bastard Menu</a>.</p></font></BODY></HTML>
