The phone rings. Shit!</p><p>I turn the page on the excuse sheet. &quot;SOLAR FLARES&quot; stares out at me. I'd better read up on that. Two minutes later I'm ready to answer the phone.</p><p>&quot;Hello?&quot; I say.</p><p>&quot;WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN, I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET YOU ALL MORNING?!&quot;</p><p>I hate it when they shout at me early in the morning. It always puts me in a bad mood. You know what I mean.</p><p>&quot;Ah, yes. Well, there's been some solar activity this morning, it always disrupts electronics...&quot; I say, sweet as a sugar pie.</p><p>&quot;Huh? But I could get through to my friends?!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, that's entirely possible, solar activity is very unpredictable in it's effects. Why last week, we had some files just dissappear from a guys account while he was working on it!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Really?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Straight Up! Hey, do you want me to check your account?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes please, I've got some important stuff in there!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ok, what's your username...&quot;</p><p>He tells me. Honestly, it's like shooting a fish in a barrel. Twice. With an Elephant Gun. At point blank range. In the head.</p><p>(Do I really need to tell you the clicky clicky bit?.. I think not)</p><p>&quot;How many files are in your account?&quot; I ask</p><p>&quot;Um, well there should be about 20 in my thesis writeup, 10 or so with the data for it, and another 20 or so in a book that I'm writing&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hmmm. Well, I think we caught it just in time. You've still got 2 files left... .cshrc and .login&quot;</p><p>&quot;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaggggggggghhhh!&quot;</p><p>He sobs into the receiver a bit - it really turns my stomach.</p><p>&quot;What can I do?&quot; he sniffs</p><p>&quot;Ok, do you have any of your stuff backed up on floppy?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Some, but it's weeks old!&quot;</p><p>I fire up the bulk eraser.</p><p>&quot;Ok&quot; I say &quot;How about I come out and load all that data onto your account pronto so you can get some work done?&quot;</p><p>&quot;That'd be great, but it's all at home&quot; he wimpers. &quot;I spose I'll just load it all in myself tonight&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sure. But remember what I said, solar flares are bad for disks and machines. Protect your disks from solar activity to prevent them losing their data&quot;</p><p>&quot;How do I do that? Wrap them in tin-foil?&quot;</p><p>&quot;NO! TIN FOIL'S THE WORST THING! YOU KNOW WHAT TIN FOIL DOES IN A MICROWAVE DON'T YOU?!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes..&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then don't use it. There's only one thing that protects disks from solar activity..&quot;</p><p>&quot;What's that?&quot;</p><p>&quot;MAGNETS! Wrap your disks up in a pillow case with lots of magnets - Solar Flares hate that&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wow! Thanks&quot;</p><p>&quot;No worries at all...&quot;</p><hr noshade width=80%><p align=center><font color="#ECA4A4"><blink>WARNING!</blink></font> I know it's really stupid saying this, but if you really do wrap a disk in magnets, you need help. So don't do it. This is FICTION. FICK-SHIN.</p><hr noshade><p align=center>Previous : <a href="bofh5.html">BOFH #5</a><br>  Next : <a href="bofh7.html">BOFH #7</a></p><p align=center>Back to <a href="../index.html#Original">The Bastard Menu</a>.</p></font></BODY></HTML>
