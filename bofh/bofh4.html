It's payday. I think I'll take some calls. I put the phone back on the hook. It rings.</p><p>&quot;I've been trying to get you for hours!&quot; the voice at the other end screams</p><p>&quot;Not, it can't be hours&quot; I say, putting &quot;Blade Runner&quot; back into it's cover and looking at the back, &quot;it was more like 114 minutes. I was on a long phone call with the big boss, trying to get you users some better facilities&quot;</p><p>Hook; Line; and Sinker...</p><p>&quot;Oh. I'm sorry.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's ok, I'm a tolerant person&quot; I make a mental note to change his password to something nasty in the next couple of days.</p><p>&quot;Um, I need to know how to rename a file&quot; he says.</p><p>Oh dear... Hang on, it's payday isn't it?! I'm in a good mood.</p><p>&quot;Sure. You just go 'rm' and the filename&quot;</p><p>&quot;Thanks&quot;</p><p>&quot;No worries&quot; (Now I'm in a *REALLY* good mood. I think I just might write that script to make saving impossible on rogue at random times like I've been thinking about)</p><p>The phone rings again.</p><p>&quot;Hello?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hi there&quot; I say</p><p>&quot;Is this the Operators?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes it is&quot; I say, nice as pie</p><p>&quot;Could you get my printouts out please. I need them urgently, and I printed them over 5 minutes ago&quot;</p><p>&quot;Your username?&quot; I ask</p><p>He gives it to me, and I write it down for later. &quot;No worries at all!&quot; I say, and head to the printers.</p><p>There's a HUUUUUUUGE pile of printouts there, and sure enough, his is at the top of the pile. I pick it up, split it out of the rest and pour our ink-stained cleaning alcohol all over it, run it over a couple of times with the loaded tape trolley then slam it in the tape safe door some times as well.</p><p>Beautiful.</p><p>&quot;Here's your printout&quot; I say &quot;Sorry about the delay, we've got a few printer problems.&quot;</p><p>He takes a look and shits himself.</p><p>&quot;Well, can I print it again?&quot; he asks, worried</p><p>&quot;Sure you can&quot; I say &quot;But no promises, the printer's a bit stuffed today&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well can I print it on laser - is that working?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah of course, but that'll cost you&quot; I say, oozing compassion for the geek</p><p>&quot;It doesn't matter about the cost, THIS IS URGENT!&quot;</p><p>I slide-on back into the printer room and put in the toner cartridge we save for special occasions - the one that prints thick black lines down the middle of the page and is all faint on one side. It took me quite a while to make it like that too. The printout shoots through and I bring it out immediately - I don't want to miss this!</p><p>&quot;W-w-what's happened to my printout?&quot; the geek squeals at me. Lucky I wrote that username down - I'm really starting to develop a taste for torture.</p><p>&quot;Well nothing. I mean sure, it's a little soiled, but that cartridge has already done 47 thousand pages and been refilled 17 times. It's quite good compared to some we get&quot;</p><p>Geek pays up and starts blubbing.</p><p>&quot;Hey now. There's no reason to cry! Have you got a disk with your work on it?&quot;</p><p>He gives me a box of diskettes and I step inside and buzz them thru the bulk eraser. I come back out again.</p><p>&quot;Sorry, I just remembered, our machine is on the fritz, you'll have to take these to the other side of campus to the machine there, it'll print them ok, and it had a brand-new toner yesterday.&quot;</p><p>&quot;GREAT!&quot;</p><p>&quot;No worries. Oh, and hold the disks above your head the whole way there, the earth's magnetic field is particularly strong today.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No arguements, just do it.&quot;</p><p>He wanders off, hands held high. Shit, I hate myself sometimes!</p><hr noshade><p align=center>Previous : <a href="bofh3.html">BOFH #3</a><br>  Next : <a href="bofh5.html">BOFH #5</a></p><p align=center>Back to <a href="../index.html#Original">The Bastard Menu</a>.</p></font></BODY></HTML>
