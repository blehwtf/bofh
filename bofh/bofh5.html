I must admit that today's lot is PARTICULARLY boring, not one good message in all of them. I was expecting at LEAST some veiled reference to a grope in a storeroom, but nothing. So I'm bored senseless by the usual drivel about some relative's surgery and how the weather is over the other side of the world - that sort of crap.</p><p>To relieve the boredom, I remove a e-mail party invite from a user's mail and post it under the senders username to alt.singles.with.severe.social.dysfunctions on news, and make a note in my diary to be there with my camcorder. Should be a blast!</p><p>Next in line is the online medical records database, in which the company doctors store the current medical histories of the staff. I grep it quickly for &quot;herpes&quot; and &quot;syphillus&quot; and send the results to the local scum newspaper. I cover my tracks by adding an entry to one of the doctor's online electronic diarys for yesterday saying &quot;$500, Med Recs To Paper&quot; I think that's all it should take.. That'll be the last time he doesn't shift appointments to make room for me..</p><p>I move some tapes from the racks to the trolley to make it look like we really use them, then start looking thru archie listings for a hidden x-gif site. I find one then start a batch job running under some user's account to get them all back, charged to him. I make sure he's got enough disk for the job by removing any files not related to the task at hand. Like all those &quot;Doctorate Final Report&quot; papers that have got quite large in the last couple of weeks.</p><p>I go back to the mail now, as something's bound to have happened. I do a grep on all mail files for the words &quot;pregnant&quot; and &quot;family way&quot;, and post them anonymously to the local general interest newsgroup.</p><p>Then, before anything can happen, the power goes out! The next second, the phone rings.</p><p>&quot;Hello?&quot; I say, annoyed - the coyote was just about to kill roadrunner again!</p><p>&quot;Has the comput..&quot;</p><p>I hang up. This is a matter of life or death. Quick as I can I rip the computer power cable out of the UPS and plug the TV in. Damn! Wylie missed again!</p><p>Meantime, all the alarms are going off like crazy as the disks spin down, but that's ok, because my Mac and Terminal are hardwired to the UPS in any case; and I'm at the Beer Factory level in Dark Castle too!</p><p>The phone rings, so I pull the PABX breaker on the UPS switchboard and it stops. Now to look like I'm working. I break out the puck and the hockey stick and play a little one-on-wall. From the observation window it'll look like I'm being blindingly efficient, as per usual.</p><p>10 Minutes later, the power is back and we're two HDA's down, but what the hell, I haven't lost a man, I'm onto the final screen, and there's more cartoons!</p><p>The phone rings, it's a luser. (What a surprise)</p><p>&quot;Computer Room&quot; I say, being efficient</p><p>&quot;Hello, When will the compu...&quot;</p><p>I hang up.</p><p>I'm doing well in the screen, all I need do is get past the wizard who throws spells at you and I'm in!</p><p>The phone rings again. I put it on hands free</p><p>&quot;Computer Room&quot; I shout, still deep in the game.</p><p>&quot;I've lost my files&quot; a user whines over the loudspeaker</p><p>&quot;You bet you have&quot; I say, as my concentration lapses just long enough for me to get zapped by the wizard.</p><p>&quot;What was your username?&quot; I say, all sweetness and smiles</p><p>He tells me, I look, and he's right. Shit, and I didn't even do it!</p><p>Not to be outdone, I change his login directory to the null device, set his path to &quot;.&quot; and redefine the command &quot;news&quot; to execute a script in his old login directory to send a nasty message to the equal opportunities officer, then delete itself.</p><p>Now that's trying!</p><hr noshade><p align=center>Previous : <a href="bofh4.html">BOFH #4</a><br>  Next : <a href="bofh6.html">BOFH #6</a></p><p align=center>Back to <a href="../index.html#Original">The Bastard Menu</a>.</p></font></BODY></HTML>
