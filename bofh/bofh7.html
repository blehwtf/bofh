I tell him that all he has to do is make sure the receiver doesn't accidentally get put back on the hook. He agrees and I'm off.</p><p>First stop, the bank. I change a $50 note into coins and then ask to see a balance of my account. Then I yank the power lead out of the teller's vdu. It dies. I say I'm in a hurry and is the manager around?</p><p>He rolls over like a man-sized twinkie and asks what the problem is. I say that all I want is a balance of my accounts. I cross my fingers. YES! He finds the vdu lead out, plugs it in, and logs in, TO THE MANAGER'S ACCOUNT. Now's my chance - I slip up against the counter, slopping 200 coins across the counter. The manager ignores it, but all the tellers dive for the money. I watch, unobserved, as the manager types in his password at the breakneck speed of one character a minute. At that rate I should've got $100 worth.... He finishes typing. &quot;MONEY&quot;. What a toughy! Well, that's my mortgage taken care of tonight...</p><p>A user that I recognise from &quot;D(eletion)-Day '89&quot; approaches. I think he's going to talk to me!! Even the bank manager is shaking his head furiously. But it's too late, he stops.</p><p>&quot;Um, excuse me, Could you tell me what is the best computer to buy to do my thesis on?&quot;</p><p>?!</p><p>Right.</p><p>&quot;You've heard of Commodore 64's?&quot; I ask</p><p>&quot;Yes?..&quot;</p><p>&quot;Avoid them like the plague! Not many people know this, but computers aren't made to handle that much memory - it's over 64,000 things, more in some cases. It's a recipe for disaster!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Try something safe and proven. A ZX81 with dual cassette drive if you can get it. The 1K ram model. Write that down. Don't buy a disk drive - You know how they're always failing, but music cassettes last forever!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hey thanks!&quot;</p><p>&quot;No worries. What was your username again?&quot;</p><p>He tells me. Just in time for D-Day 92. You'd think they'd learn.</p><p>I get back to work and the janitor's asleep at the terminal. I ask him if he wants to work here too, but he likes the ability to bust in on people when they're in the toilet...</p><p>I put the phone back on the hook, and straight away it rings. I hate it when it does that, it takes me AGES to get my walkman phones in.</p><p>It's the hottest hosemonster I've ever met, and she's got a computer problem! I love it when that happens!</p><p>&quot;What's your username?&quot; I ask</p><p>She tells me (as if I didn't know)</p><p>Quick as I can I read all her e-mail (mostly boring stuff), then grep everyone else's mail files for her username. Nothing. Excellent!</p><p>&quot;What's the problem?&quot; I ask, all smiles and charm.</p><p>&quot;I can't save my documents, it says something about space.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not a problem for long&quot; I say, and delete everyone else on the same disk as her. &quot;You should be fine now..&quot;</p><p>&quot;Thank you so much&quot; she gushes. I make a mental note to do something to her account again tomorrow. &quot;No worries.&quot;</p><p>The phone rings almost before I've got it on the hook.</p><p>&quot;My files are all gone!&quot; a voice whines out at me.</p><p>&quot;When did this happen?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&quot;Just now...&quot; he says, through the tears</p><p>&quot;I see. Well, I wouldn't worry, there's three days till the end of the semester, if you work day and night until then, you should get at least a C-&quot;</p><p>He sobs a couple more times then hangs up. What a wimp.</p><p>THE PHONE RINGS AGAIN!</p><p>&quot;The screen on my PC is really dim&quot; The woman at the other end says &quot;Should I wind the brightness knob up?&quot;</p><p>&quot;NO!&quot; I scream &quot;Don't touch that knob! Have you any idea of the radiation that comes out of that thing when the knob gets wound up?!!!!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well I...&quot; she says, all uncertain</p><p>&quot;TAKE MY ADVICE!&quot; I say &quot;There's only ONE way to fix a dim display, and that's by power surging the drivers&quot;</p><p>The words &quot;power surging&quot; and &quot;drivers&quot; have got her. People hear words like that and go into Dummy Mode and do ANYTHING you say. I could tell her to run naked across campus with a powercord rammed up her backside and she'd probably do it... Hmmm...</p><p>&quot;Have you got a spare power cord?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No..&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh well, never mind, we'll have to do the power surge idea... Ok, quick as you can, I want you to flick the power switch of your PC on and off 30 times&quot;</p><p>&quot;Should I take my disks out?&quot;</p><p>&quot;NO! Do you want to lose all your data!?!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh! NO! Ok..&quot;</p><p>I listen carefully.. ..</p><p>...clicky..clikcy...clikky.. .. .. ...clicky. ...cliccy.. . . BOOM!</p><p>Amazing, it probably made it to 27 - the power supply usually shits itself at 15 or so...</p><p>&quot;MY COMPUTER BLEW UP!!!&quot; she screams at me down the line</p><p>&quot;Really? Must've been a dodgy power supply! Lucky we found out now! Is your machine still under warranty?&quot;</p><p>&quot;NO!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Dear oh dear. Well, Best get it repaired then. Did you backup your files?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, to the system, Yesterday, but all this morning's work is gone!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh dear. What was your username, I'll just check that your backups worked ok?&quot;</p><p>She tells me....</p><hr noshade><p align=center>Previous : <a href="bofh6.html">BOFH #6</a><br>  Next : <a href="bofh8.html">BOFH #8</a></p><p align=center>Back to <a href="../index.html#Original">The Bastard Menu</a>.</p></font></BODY></HTML>
