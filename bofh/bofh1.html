Being the BOFH, however, does have it's advantages. I reassign null to be the tape device - it's so much more economical on my time as I don't have to keep getting up to change tapes every 5 minutes. And it speeds up backups too, so it can't be all bad can it? Of course not.</p><p>A user rings</p><p>&quot;Do you know why the system is slow?&quot; they ask</p><p>&quot;It's probably something to do with...&quot; I look up today's excuse &quot;.. clock speed&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh&quot; (Not knowing what I'm talking about, they're satisfied) &quot;Do you know when it will be fixed?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Fixed? There's 275 users on your machine, and one of them is you. Don't be so selfish - logout now and give someone else a chance!&quot;</p><p>&quot;But my research results are due in tommorrow and all I need is one page of Laser Print..&quot;</p><p>&quot;SURE YOU DO. Well, you just keep telling yourself that buddy!&quot; I hang up.</p><p>You'd really think people would learn not to call..</p><p>The phone rings. It'll be him again, I know. That annoys me. I put on a gruff voice</p><p>&quot;HELLO, SALARIES!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, I'm sorry, I've got the wrong number&quot;</p><p>&quot;YEAH? Well what's your name buddy? Do you know WASTED phone calls cost money? DO YOU? I've got a good mind to subtract your wasted time, my wasted time, and the cost of this call from your weekly wages! IN FACT I WILL! By the time I've finished with you, YOU'LL OWE US money! WHAT'S YOUR NAME - AND DON'T LIE, WE'VE GOT CALLER ID!!&quot;</p><p>I hear the phone drop and the sound of running feet - he's obviously going to try and get an alibi by being at the Dean's office. I look up his username and find his department. I ring the Dean's secretary.</p><p>&quot;Hello?&quot; she answers</p><p>&quot;Hi, SIMON, B.O.F.H. HERE, LISTEN, WHEN THAT GUY COMES RUNNING INTO YOUR OFFICE IN ABOUT 10 SECONDS, CAN YOU GIVE HIM A MESSAGE?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I think so...&quot; she says</p><p>&quot;TELL HIM `HE CAN RUN, BUT HE CAN'T HIDE'&quot;</p><p>&quot;Um. Ok&quot;</p><p>&quot;AND DON'T FORGET NOW, I WOULDN'T WANT TO HAVE TO TELL ANYONE ABOUT THAT FILE IN YOUR ACCOUNT WITH YOUR ANSWERS TO THE PURITY TEST IN IT...&quot;</p><p>I hear her scrabbling at the terminal...</p><p>&quot;DON'T BOTHER - I HAVE A COPY. BE A GOOD PERVY AND PASS THE MESSAGE ON..&quot;</p><p>She sobs her assent and I hang up. And the worst thing is, I was just guessing about the purity test thing. I grab a quick copy anyway, it might make for some good late-night reading.</p><p>Meantime backups have finished in record time, 2.03 seconds. Modern technology is wonderful, isn't it?</p><p>Another user rings.</p><p>&quot;I need more space&quot; he says</p><p>&quot;Well, why not move to Texas?&quot; I ask</p><p>&quot;No, on my account, stupid.&quot;</p><p>Stupid? Uh-Oh..</p><p>&quot;I'm terribly sorry&quot; I say, in a polite manner equal to that of Jimmy Stewart in a Weekend Family Matine Feature &quot;I didn't quite catch that. What was it that you said?&quot;</p><p>I smell the fear coming down the line at me, but it's too late, he's a goner and he knows it.</p><p>&quot;Um, I said what I wanted was more space on my account, *please*&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sure, hang on&quot;</p><p>I hear him gasp his relief even though he'd covered the mouthpeice.</p><p>&quot;There, you've got *plenty* of space now!&quot;</p><p>&quot;How much have I got?&quot; he simps</p><p>Now this *REALLY* *PISSES* *ME* *OFF*! Not only do they want me to give them extra space, they want to check it, then correct me if I don't give them enough! They should be happy with what I give them *and that's it*!</p><p>Back into Jimmy Stewart mode.</p><p>&quot;Well, let's see, you have 4 Meg available&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wow! Eight Meg in total, thanks!&quot; he says, pleased with his bargaining power</p><p>&quot;No&quot; I interrupt, savouring this like a fine red at room temperature, with steak, extra rare, to follow; &quot;4 Meg in total..&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh? I'd used 4 Meg already, How could I have 4 Meg Available?&quot;</p><p>I say nothing. It'll come to him.</p><p>&quot;aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagggggghhhhhH!&quot;</p><p>I kill me; I really do! </p><hr noshade><p align=center>Previous : <a href="genesis3.html">Still Birthing the Bastard Operator</a><br>Next : <a href="bofh2.html">BOFH #2</a></p><p align=center>Back to <a href="../index.html#Original">The Bastard Menu</a>.</p></font></BODY></HTML>
