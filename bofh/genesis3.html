It's amazing what you learn isn't it?!&quot;</p><p>&quot;What are you again?&quot; I ask, already suspecting the answer</p><p>&quot;Chief Engineer&quot;</p><p>Thought so.</p><p>&quot;Say, do you know anything about waffle irons?&quot;</p><p>&quot;A little...&quot;</p><p>&gt;Click!&lt; &gt;Fzzzzzzeeet!&lt; &gt;Clunk&lt;</p><hr noshade><p align=center>Previous : <a href="genesis2.html">The Birth of BOFH</a><br>Next : <a href="bofh1.html">BOFH #1</a></p><p align=center>Back to <a href="../index.html#Original">The Bastard Menu</a>.</p></font></BODY></HTML>
