I pick it up.</p><p>&quot;Hello?&quot; I say.</p><p>&quot;Who is this?&quot; they say</p><p>&quot;It's me I think&quot; I say, having successfully attended a telephone skills course</p><p>&quot;Me Who?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Is this like a knock knock joke?&quot; I say, trying anything to save myself having to end this game.</p><p>Too LATE! I get killed.</p><p>Now I'm pissed!</p><p>&quot;What can I do for you?&quot; I ask pleasantly - (one of the key warning signs)</p><p>&quot;Um, I want to know if we have a particular software package..&quot;</p><p>&quot;Which package is that?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Uh, B-A-S-I-C it's called.&quot;</p><p>&gt;clickety clickety d-e-l b-a-s-i-c.e-x-e&lt;</p><p>&quot;Um no, we don't have that. We used to though..&quot;</p><p>&quot;oh. Oh well, the other thing I wanted to know was, could the contents of my account be copied to tape to I have a permanent copy of them to save at home in case the worst happens..&quot;</p><p>&quot;The worst?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, like they get deleted or something...&quot;</p><p>&quot;DELETED! Oh, don't worry about that, we have backups!&quot; (I'm such a *shit*) &quot;What was your username?&quot;</p><p>He gives me his lusername. (What an idiot)</p><p>&gt;clickety click&lt;</p><p>&quot;But you haven't got any files in your account!&quot; I say, mock surprise leaping from my vocal chords.</p><p>&quot;Yes I have, you must be looking in the wrong place!&quot;</p><p>So first he spoils my x-tank game, and *now* he's calling me a liar...</p><p>&gt;clickety click&lt;</p><p>&quot;Oh no, I made a mistake&quot; I say</p><p>Did he mutter &quot;typical&quot; under his breath??!? Oh dear, oh dear..</p><p>&quot;I MEANT TO SAY: That USERNAME doesn't exist&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh? &gt;wimper&lt; It must do, I was only using it this morning!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ah well, that'll be the problem, there was a virus in our system this morning, the... uh... DE VINCI Virus, wipes out users who are logged in when it goes off.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That can't be right, my girlfriend was logged in, and I'm in her account now!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Which one was that?&quot;</p><p>He tells me the username. Some people NEVER learn..</p><p>&quot;Oh, yeah, her account was just after we discovered the virus.&quot;... &gt;clickety click&lt; &quot;..she only lost all her files&quot;</p><p>&quot;But...&quot;</p><p>&quot;But don't worry, we've got them all on tape&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, thank goodness!!!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Paper tape. Have you got a magnifying glass and a pencil? SEE YOU IN THE MACHINE ROOM!!!! NYAHAHAHAHAHA!&quot;</p><p>I'm such a prick!</p><hr noshade><p align=center>Previous : <a href="bofh1.html">BOFH #1</a><br>Next : <a href="bofh3.html">BOFH #3</a></p><p align=center>Back to <a href="../index.html#Original">The Bastard Menu</a>.</p></font></BODY></HTML>
