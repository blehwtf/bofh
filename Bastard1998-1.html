These are the voyages of the Bastard Operator from Hell, his 1998 mission - to seek out boldish type people with a penchant for salt air and the company of sailors, and report them to the Widow's Pension Fund. Why? We may never know. Certainly the Widow's Pension Fund has no idea, which is what makes it all that more exciting. Go on, reach for the phone - talk to someone you haven't spoken to for years - a parent, a sibling, that guy from the video parlour who STILL works there after 20 years when the only video game they had was that shitty tennis thing with the bats and balls. Meantime... </font><HR><P> <CENTER>  <H2><font size="6" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Bastard     Operator from Hell 1998 - Series Alpha</font></H2></CENTER><P><HR><CENTER>  <H2><font size="6" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> An ugly saga of burning     ambition and bootleg liquor ‚ welcome to the BOFH's Christmas past... </font></H2></CENTER><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A new year ‚ how quickly time flies. It seems like only yesterday I was at the divisional pre-Christmas bash. <P> Admittedly I had consumed a couple of glasses of the mulled medicine so popular   at that time of year, so my memory of events isn't too clear, but I do remember   helping one of our more vocal clients bob for apples in the punch bowl ‚ letting   him up for air occasionally ‚ just before that tragic accident with the Christmas   tree. <P> Who could have known the lights were mains voltage, apart from the installer   from B-Electrix of course. Still, the burning smell, screaming and impromptu   breakdance act that followed the fall of the tree into the punch bowl, just   as the boss was serving up another bucket of non-alcoholic refresher, was a   good finale to the day and cost substantially less than a real fireworks display. <P> And to think that things were going to be different for Christmas 1997. The   directive had come from on-high that anyone caught with alcohol on the premises   was up for a quick stroll down unemployment avenue, courtesy of personnel. <P> Some people just have no sense of humour, I remember musing as I stashed a   couple of half-empty spirits bottles in the bottom drawer of a particularly   annoying user's desk. Unfortunately duty called, and I was unable to be there   10 minutes later when security acted on their anonymous phone tip-off about   sly boozing on work time. Still, you can't have everything can you? <P> The PFY and I, true to 'Secure' Christmas protocol, had our booze safely stashed   in Mission Control inside a set of what to outward appearances appeared to be   run-of-the-mill fire extinguishers ‚ a supply of which I keep on hand for special   occasions. <P> Its amazing what money can buy. And if not money, certainly a couple of photos   of an occupational safety consultant in full drag ensemble on stage at a progressive   (and supposedly private) London club. <P> Sadly, after the tree incident, I have to defer to the PFY's reminiscences   as I'd had an extinguisher-full and my memory was as clear as the terms of a   typical software licence agreement. <P> Apparently, events unfolded in the following order: <P> At 4.15pm I helped the PFY make a replacement non-alcoholic punch ‚ after   bringing a couple of extinguishers down from the office to replace the ones   used to put the boss out. <P> At approximately 5pm the party was starting to get into full swing with people   appreciating the 'non-alcoholic' punch so much that I had to go get another   couple of extinguishers to protect the PFY from spontaneous orange juice combustion   while he mixed another batch up. <P> At approximately 6.17pm (from CCTV timestamps) I mounted a table and launched   into the old party favourite 'The boss is so dumb'. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"How dumb is he?" the well-oiled   crowd demanded. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"He's so dumb he can't   even spell IT." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"He's so dumb he broke   his toe rebooting his desktop." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"He thought preventative   maintenance meant locking the engineer out." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"He has to study for a   urine test. He's also lazy." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"How lazy is he?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"He just finished his autobiography   ‚ Around the Cafeteria in 80 Days." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> By 8.30pm the party was   going downhill (or uphill, depending on your perspective) fast ‚ the mixers   had run out and the punch was pretty much a combination of gin and cleaning   alcohol. The PFY was demonstrating to anyone interested how to secure a Windows   NT machine, using only a hammer and the boss's new laptop. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The end came at around   10.45pm, as it usually does, with the arrival of the boss back from the casualty   department. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Already fuming from his   facial burns, his temper wasn't improved any when he heard party music coming   from every security guard's walkie-talkie, courtesy of Radio IT and its drunken   DJs. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Not recognising him at   first because of the bandages, the PFY apparently tried to sign him up for the   spitting competition ‚ nearest to the boss's coffee mug wins, bonus prize for   getting it in. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Right!" the boss cried,   upsetting the punch bowl as he barged over to the turntables to cut the lights   and music. "That's bloody it, turn that bloody music off." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In retrospect, I'm sure   the boss would have thought twice about walking past the candles on the Christmas   cake with punch-soaked trousers but there you go. Even my patchy memory can   recall the boss bouncing around in terror, pants on fire. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> If only they hadn't used   the nearest extinguisher I'm sure things would have ended differently. Still,   two fireworks displays are better than one, and the troops really did enjoy   taking turns on the fire hose ‚ an unexpected Christmas bonus, so to speak.   </font><P> <P><HR><CENTER>  <H2><font size="6" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The BOFH and PFY show     there is still a place for love and compassion in the world of network management...     </font></H2></CENTER><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Networks.... AND systems," I cry, "I like it!" The PFY shares my enthusiasm, realising the full potential for dodgy deals at our fingertips. "What was it Orwell used to say?" he responds cheerily, "All power corrupts, absolute power..." "... is even more fun," I finish. <P> Following the coup d'etat at the end of last year, the PFY and I have got   it all - the network, the machines, the head of department's password-changing   methodology - use the same word year after year, but just increment the numeric   suffix by one. <P> Mind you, it beats addingan 's' to the end of it, as was his original practice. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"New car please," I cry.   </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The PFY depresses a button,   and down in a packed storeroom in the basement, a tape stacker unit whirs into   life. However, instead of the DLT cartridges it's used to working with, it's   current payload is seven slot cars. A robot arm grabs one and deposits it onto   the track set out around the locked room. Checking its position on the CCTV,   I turn to the PFY. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Right, how about a 10   lap job? Loser has to reload the stacker and answer the phones for the rest   of the day." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You're on," says the PFY,   lulled into a false sense of security by my previous effort which ended badly   at a particularly sharp corner. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Just 15 minutes later the   PFY's down in the basement reloading the stacker. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> While he's gone. I return   the acceleration settings on the PFY's slot car driver to normal - cheating   on a game of skill, how can I stoop so low? Years of practise, that's how. It's   been hard going but now I can stoop lower than a pygmy limbo dancer. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Upon his return the full   weight of his loss descends upon the PFY's shoulders. Our increased role means   increased responsibility, and worse still, increased user interaction. A newly   arrived phone rings. I smile smugly at the PFY as he answers it. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Hi, look I've forgotten   my password on the human resources system and I need to get into the database   this morning." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"OK," the PFY responds   with uncharacteristic helpfulness. "Just bring your ID up here and we'll change   it for you." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I'm just about to book   in for a hearing check-up when I notice the PFY switching the lifts into weekend   mode, effectively making them lockdown at the ground floor. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A couple of minutes later   a chunky personnel type wheezes through the door after slogging the two flights   of stairs to our office. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I'm here to get my password   changed." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh, I'm sorry, the PFY   has just gone down to your office to change it for you," I say, as the PFY plays   dead under the desk. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"He told me to meet him   up here," our visitor gasps. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No, I'm sure he said he   was going down to meet you." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh. Well can you change   it then?" the user pants. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I could, but he's likely   to change it and overwrite the change that I make." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh," the user mutters   and trundles back downstairs. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A couple of minutes later   he's back on the phone. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It's about my password,"   he says </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Ah yes," the PFY responds,   "You weren't in your office when I came down. How about you wander up and I'll   change it immediately for you?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"But I was just up there   and I talked to the other guy." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, you're just going   to have to come up here again aren't you?" </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The phone slams down and   the PFY goes back into the lift maintenance menu. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> After the third time the   wheezing's so bad I make the PFY come out of hiding and change the password   before the poor user has a coronary. I know, I know, Mr Softy, that's me. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Of course, it would have   caused the poor guy a lot less discomfort if the PFY hadn't replaced his asthma   inhaler propellant with helium, causing him to panic that his vocal passage   was prolapsing, and then faint. On the way down he takes my CD-ROM drive with   him, which puts me in a foul mood. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I'm forced to get the next   call while the PFY drags the unconscious body to the sick bay. Well, puts him   in the freight elevator and presses the relevant floor anyway. Never let it   be said that we don't care about our users. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Hi, I've got to get some   important sales data off a floppy which says it's in DOS format." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"DOS format?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"That's easy. Go into DOS."   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Uh-Huh." >clickety click   "And use the FORMAT command." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh, of course." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Another barrel shoot successfully   completed. </font><P> <P><HR><CENTER>  <H2><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Chaos reigns at the     office and a visitor from the past is impressed by modern standards of bastardly     behaviour... </font></H2></CENTER><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> We return you now to Baker Street, where Sherlock Holmes and his faithful assistant, Doctor Watson have, through some undiscovered law of quantum science, been transported to the present century... </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It appears we have moved   forward in time," the great man decides. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"But that's impossible   Holmes," I cried incredulously. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Not so Watson," he replied,   reaching for his snuff container. "Why, on several occasions I myself have considered   the possibility while partaking of this fine white powder. Mirror please, Watson.   But what really concerns me is why we have been brought here." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I..." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Let us have a brisk constitutional   and see if we cannot discover something upon which to test our intellectual   mettle." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> And so it was that Holmes   and I came upon a large building with doors that opened as if by magic. A moving   staircase that Holmes surmised was driven by electricity drew us to a mezzanine   area where a smoking box lay on the floor. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I don't know what happened,"   a man nearby was explaining to a uniformed gentleman. "I'd called the helpdesk   because the screen was shimmering, and they put me through to the systems and   networks operator. I hadn't even finished telling them about it when it burst   into flames." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Did you hear a clicking   sound, not altogether unlike that of a typewriter?" Holmes asked him. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Why, yes I did," he replied.   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"And did you hear a noise   on the telephone that may have been chuckling?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Now you come to mention   it..." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"And what about that?"   Holmes asked, indicating a small projection device upon which little people   were running in panic. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"That's the emergency response   room - there's a panic on because the fire alarms have gone off and the halon   activation delay switch isn't working." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> As we watch, one of the   figures trips over a length of cabling. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Uh-oh, another one down."   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Would I be correct in   assuming that this room isn't used very often?" Holmes asks. "Yeah, that's why   the cabling's all over the show," the guard replies. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"And did they perchance   call upon the networks and systems people to make the room available to them?"   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"As a matter of fact they   did." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Just as I suspected."   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What?" the uniformed gentleman   asked. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I cannot be sure yet,"   Holmes replied inscrutably. "More investigation will be necessary. If you would   be so kind as to direct me to the systems and networks people you were referring   to." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I can't direct you because   you need swipe card access to get in and out of the lifts and rooms. I'll take   you instead." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> And so it was that we rose   in a mechanical elevator to an upper floor of the building. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Just knock on the door   and you'll be let in," the guard murmured, almost as if he was afraid of the   place. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Wanting to waste no more   time, I did this while Holmes thanked the guard profusely and shook his hand.   By the time he'd returned to the door, there was still no answer from the room   within, although I could see people moving about behind the opaque glass. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I don't think we're going   to be let in, Holmes." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Nonsense," he said as   he slid a small card through a slot. With a beep the door opened. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Good Lord!" I cried "Where   on earth did you get that?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The guard's pocket." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"But doesn't he need that   to exit the elevator?" </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Holmes paused for a moment,   listening carefully. A muffled thumping could be heard in the distance... "Apparently   so." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Upon entering the room   we found two men, a young one with facial eruptions, the other somewhat older,   with a sense of power about him, somewhat similar to Holmes. A kind of unspoken   recognition passed between them. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I believe I can now solve   this enigma," Holmes said. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"But first a couple of   pints," the older stranger cried. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Barely ten minutes later,   Holmes, myself, the two men and four women were enjoying a couple of lagers   at a nearby tavern. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Another case successfully   concluded," Holmes murmured. "Care for some of my special snuff Watson?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Your special snuff Holmes?"   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes, the stuff I keep   for guests." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Rather... Bloody hell   - that's talcum powder and cayenne pepper. I thought you said that was the stuff   you kept for guests!" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well of course it is Watson,   you don't think I'd take it myself do you?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You bastard Holmes!" </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Through streaming eyes   I saw the two strangers shake Holmes by the hand. Curiouser and curiouser...   </font><P> <P><HR><CENTER>  <H2><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The head's mid-life     crisis and how a career in modelling leads to an executive position... </font>    <P> </H2></CENTER><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It is truly pathetic. Sad male heads-of-department of a certain age, realising they're no longer in the youth, or even middle-aged category, suddenly attempting to alter their lifestyle to compensate. <P> And so it is that the head of IT, with designer-coloured cellphone and laptop   and brand new convertible car, has appointed a flashy young smooth-talker to   the position of executive liaison officer. <P> It's easy to see how her previous experience in the modelling industry is   so close to information systems that a couple of days of reading glossy mags   will have her up to speed... </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I can't see that she's   such a problem," the boss cries. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"She can't even spell IT,   let alone be in the position of making service delivery promises to all and   sundry," I protest. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"She must know something   about IT to get appointed," the boss responds, confirming my suspicion that   he's a card-carrying member of NaivetÈ International. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I see. And how long did   it take her to get her desktop machine going again?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The power switch is quite   difficult to find," he replies, as loyal as a terrier. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> My worst fears are confirmed   when she decides to buy up a whole swag of network computers, "Because we won't   ever have to worry about upgrading." This poorly researched decision has obtained   the official stamp of approval and a purchase order has appeared on my desk   for a 'technical sign-off'. I stuff it into the shredder quicker than the average   user could say "Where's my hard disk gone?" </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The boss is on the job   in record time. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"These network computers   are great," he gasps, flashing a glossy brochure. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"And why is that?" I ask.   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Because they act just   like PCs without disks," he cries. "They're good because everything they need   to operate is loaded from the computer." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Sort of like a dumb terminal,   with graphic and sound capabilities." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Uh... no, much faster,   and in colour." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"So it's a bit like changing   a black and white TV for a colour one." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Uh... Not exactly." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"So we're going to move   from independent computers to ones dependent on a server - like ASCII terminal   days. So when the main machine is down, no work gets done. Isn't that why we   got desktop machines?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Ahhhh... No, not really."   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh. So they're different   from, say, an NCD in what way?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Because we'll never need   to upgrade the equipment. It'll be like your colour TV set," the boss blurts   triumphantly. "Once you've got one, it'll never need upgrading - just upgrade   the server software." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Not even when the software   grows and needs more memory?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Not even when the software   wants to make use of whizzy new features like Nicam stereo, Dolby surround,   and wide screen?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Look, we're bloody buying   some, so sign off on them," the boss shouts. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> What the hell, I scrawl   out a signature. Not mine of course, but who's to know? Except the boss, should   someone check it against his. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"In fact," the boss continues,   "I think you should be using the same technology as users, so order a couple   for the control room as well." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> BASTARD!! </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A few days later they arrive   and are dispatched to the test cases in various departments. The PFY and I get   ours into gear - true, we did replace the motherboard with that of a small-footprint   PC with high-speed laptop disk drives, but to all intents and purposes it looks   like the real thing. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Let the carnage commence!   </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> SNMP management is a damn   fine tool for a machine, especially when it lets you reboot the thing remotely.   I patch a game of Network DOOM with sprites of the NC users' faces and get the   kills piped to the SNMP reboot command. Kill a user, their Network Computer   goes down. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Of course, it's not very   sporting, so I ring the users and tell them, to give them a fighting chance.   Well, as much of a chance as you can get using the apps-server-based copy of   the game which only lets you pick up a handgun. Still, it's amazing how good   a beancounter can get at pistol shooting when two hours of spreadsheet work   are at stake and you have to win a game to use the Save option. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Surprisingly enough, the   NCs weren't a hit with the users and were decommissioned after only four days   (and 327 kills). </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I was thinking about a   PC version of that game," the PFY comments. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You mean the same game,   except that it causes the Pentium Hang bug on their desktop machine?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You mean you've thought   of it?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Thought of it, installed   it, and am waiting for new players with the chaingun." </font><P> <P><HR><CENTER>  <H2><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The boss is on the track     of two mysterious contractors, C. Omputer and R. Amchip, but the BOFH is on     the case... </font></H2></CENTER><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> When the PFY and I are on top of things, running the network is simple. But then the boss attempts to do his job and it all goes pear-shaped... </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Who's this Charles Omputer?"   He asks, eyeing a set of timesheets suspiciously. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Never heard of him." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You must have, you've   signed his bloody timesheet." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Charles Omputer?... Oh,   you mean Chazzer. He's a part time cable monkey we got to replace the telephone   cabling that got burnt out when some idiot had his PC jammed against the circuit   breaker on his desk." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You know very well the   circuit breaker was faulty. Anyway, I don't know how my PC got pushed back that   far." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The PFY couldn't look more   innocent if he tried. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"And it shouldn't have   affected the phone cabling," the boss continued. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It wouldn't have if someone   hadn't decided to 'cut costs' by running the extra office power through the   data ducting..." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The boss shuffles his feet.   "Anyway, Mr Omputer - he's been putting in the overtime, hasn't he?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes, although it's not   really our fault because you made us let Frank Irmware go last week because   he crashed the server." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We can't allow mistakes,"   the boss says, taking the hard line. "We have to be vigilant. Can we get a replacement?"   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, we've got a CV for   a Roger Amchip." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What's he like?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"He's been in computers   for years," the PFY pipes up. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We seem to be hiring a   lot of foreigners," the boss comments, "and how come I never meet any of them?"   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, you know the sort,   green and keen, can't wait to get into the thick of it." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I see. Well, give this   Amchip guy a call and organise a meeting with him tomorrow. Sort out any potential   overtime disputes!" </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Bugger. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"How's 'Omputer's cable   replacement' going?" I ask the PFY. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Should be done by tomorrow..."   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"And we're still keeping   up appearances?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Judging by the unhappiness   in the tea-room, apparently so..." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> If I've said it once, I've   said it a thousand times, it's the small things that count. You can't just unplug   50 telephone cables, super glue a circuit breaker shut then claim a cabling   disaster has destroyed the telecommunications hub of the floor - requiring two   weeks overtime to 'recable'. No, you have to give the appearance of work being   done while you replug the cables back in at the comms room, five per night.   </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Which is why the PFY and   I leave wire offcuts and insulation on office floors right next to a knocked-over   plant, which is supposed to disguise a hammer hole in the wall. And there's   nothing like the theft of small change from a user's desktop organiser and a   cigarette butt in their coffee mug to allay any suspicion that there were was   no cabling job and certainly no cabling professional. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> With a little extra effort,   all suspicions are avoided. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Which leaves us with the   problem of Roger Amchip... </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The boss trolls into work   in time to find a set of legs sticking out from under his desk. Being a total   wimp, he sends me in to take a look. I flip the boss's desktop circuit breaker   to off and grope around a bit. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No pulse," I cry. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The boss screams and then   power-unloads last night's biriani. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I'll get an ambulance."   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No point, he's stone cold   - feel his leg." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The boss squeamishly touches   the leg. "Oh God. Who?" he asks quietly. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Amchip. He was keen to   get to work last night. Must have been electrocuted from the mains in the phone   and data ducting." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We'll have to call the   police." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You're right, and if I   may say so, it's very brave of you." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"To face the music like   this. A lot of people would just pay Amchip's widow off to pretend he'd run   off, rather than face a manslaughter by professional negligence charge." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Manslaughter!" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, it wasn't premeditated   was it? Although you are known to have a problem with anyone claiming overtime...   Poor Mrs Amchip." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Do you think she'd accept   money?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, these are tough   times. I think she'd probably come up with a reasonable excuse for ten grand.   They weren't that close apparently." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The boss whips out his   cheque book in record time... </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Who should I make it out   to?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Charlotte Amchip. No.   That would look suspicious... Make it out to her non-profit business - Charlotte   Amchip's Schizophrenics Hospice." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"How do you spell Schizophrenics?"   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh, just put the initials."   </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> An hour later the boss   is having a drink to calm his nerves, the PFY and I are having a drink to celebrate   our recent bonus, and the head of safety is having a lie down after finding   the lost CPR mannequin. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Amazing how things work   out for the best isn't it? </font><P> <P><HR><CENTER>  <H2><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> When the BOFH suggests     a team-building event, on his own time, there has to be some devilry brewing...     </font></H2></CENTER><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Of course I bloody did!" the pimply-faced youth (PFY) shouts angrily, slamming the phone down.<P> Sensing tension in the air, I ask him what's up.</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"A bloody user - he's been   to the boss and complained about his network speed and got the OK to get it   fixed..."</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"And you don't fancy the   overtime?"</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I'm sick of bloody overtime."</font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The poor blighter is getting   stir-crazy from spending so much time in the office.

The PFY is getting   into the swing of things.</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Don't tell the Boss, but   a company I used to work for had this team-building weekend and when they got   back, performance was up to such a level that they laid off 30 per cent of the   staff."</font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> When I looked again the   doorway was free of shadow.</font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Later that afternoon, the   boss, looking benevolent, returns.</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I know it's short notice,"   he says, eyeing us intently, "but I've noticed that morale is down a little   recently, so I thought maybe some of us should go for a team-building weekend.   Apparently one of the hotels in Brighton has conference and relaxation facilities.   I was thinking maybe this weekend?"</font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> That 30 per cent must have   really got to him because half the IT department is on his list. The PFY and   I make a show of reluctantly accepting the offer.</font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Friday night arrives and   the PFY and I find ourselves at the hotel along with the other IT sheep. By   a strange twist of fate, our room access cards no longer access our allocated   rooms, but the large staterooms at either end of the corridor.</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Who are we to argue with   fate?" I ask the PFY as I place the magcard writer back in my luggage. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"See you in the morning."</font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Morning dawns and it's   time to pay for our sins...</font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The head of IT has a trust   exercise where the victim falls backwards off a table into the arms of his or   her co-workers.

Will he turn   up?"</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I don't know." I gave   the issue some consideration. "What are the chances of the police releasing   you when you're found stark naked in a hotel lobby beating the crap out of an   ice machine?"</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"About the same as the   chances of a team-building exercise that can't be played in the bar today?"</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Exactly." I was proud   of the PFY's perpicacity. "Make mine a lager!" </font><P> <P><HR><CENTER>  <H2><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> There's stocktaking     to be done and awkward questions to be answered. But the BOFH stays cool as     things get hot... </font></H2></CENTER><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I hate inventory time. Every bloody year it's the same: traipse around and record the ser-ial number attached to each device in a half-witted attempt to ensure that we don't steal any kit. Then the inevitable spot checks to make sure that we weren't lying.<P> It would almost be inconvenient if we didn't have a complete list of the serial   numbers and control of the program that randomly selects the equipment that's   going to be spot-checked.<P> And let me tell you, if someone ever steals the full-height 5MB hard drive,   the 600 BPI nine-track tape drive, or the ZX81 expansion memory card, there's   going to be questions asked in accounts.<P> Our spot-check kit's all in perfect nick of course - only in service for a   couple of hours every year - besides, should we require to change the inventory's   selection, there's a huge space in one of our deserted warehouses in Peckham   that's jam-packed with equipment that no-one's going to steal.<P> Not that it's necessary, given that with the frightening turnover of bean-counters   the chances of running into the same inventory auditor two years in a row is   about the same as someone discovering the boss has stashed three motor vehicles   behind packing cases in the aforementioned warehouse.<P> That's the beauty of a good alarm system - it doesn't ring bells to scare   intruders - it just dials up your Linux box and chucks a real-time movie onto   your X-terminal.<P> And so it was that the PFY and I noticed the arrival of three spanking-new   top-of-the-line vehicles in the long-term storage area of the warehouse.<P> The boss, only recently returned to us by the police, is of course to blame.   Trying to brown-nose away his sins with the CEO by reorganising this year's   executive vehicle replacement into a bulk purchase deal, he made one error.<P> It seems that somehow, unbeknownst to him, Mercedes got mixed up with Lada   on the order form, and instead of it being faxed to the reputable luxury car   dealer a SIMM's throw from our office doorstep, it somehow made it to a less-reputable   economy car dealer quite some distance away. An economy car dealer who, by some   quirk of fate had three, brand spanking new Ladas sitting at the back of his   showroom ‚ for the last six years.<P> The boss took the delivery well though. Better than he took the playing of   Johnny Cash's Ring of Fire on the cafeteria juke box over and over again after   recovering from the unorthodox medication he received at the recent team-building   weekend.<P> And so it was that I felt a modicum of animosity in the air when the boss   deigned to join the inventory auditors on their rounds.</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"A 600BPI, nine-track tape   unit?" the auditor asks.</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Ah, that would be just   over here," I respond, pointing.</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"That wasn't there yesterday,"   the boss cries, smelling rodent.</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No, we had a reshuffle   to make way for new cabling," I respond in a manner that would have got me the   Baden-Powell award for preparedness.</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I see. A Seagate five-megabyte   hard drive?"</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"That will be on the e-mail   list server."</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We don't use five-meg   hard drives any more," the boss cries.</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Afraid so," I reply. "As   the list server software runs on an old XT which only supports MFM hard drives."</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"This is ridiculous," he   cries, grabbing the auditor's sheaf of papers and fumbling into non spot-check   territory.</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What about this 29-inch   Sony TV?"</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Nicam Stereo, with text   option?" I ask. "In the boardroom, not here"</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"OK, well what about the   Sega video game?"</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It's with personnel, they   were going to use it for a creche for workers returning from maternity leave,"   I ad-lib, and far faster than the soundcard does.</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Right," he says, in a   determined manner. "The brand-new heating and cooling system, supposed to be   in this room - where is it?"</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"In the delivery room downstairs   isn't it?"</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No, I checked this morning.   They said they delivered it here."</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well perhaps it's outside   the service elevator."</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No, but I have a fair   idea of where it is. Warm at home is it?" he asks, flashing a photograph of   the outside of my flat featuring a new air-conditioner.</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I just installed a new   unit at home because I was so impressed with the spec of the system we bought."</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Bought and put where?"   the boss asks nastily. "It was in the Peckham warehouse wasn't it?" the PFY   chimes to the rescue. "Because of all the new heat-generating kit that was recently   dumped there," he mentions, pointedly.</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Ah, yes," the boss responds,   at 1,400 backpedals per second. "Of course, I should have known. Well, no problems   here."</font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Quicker than you can say   diminished responsibility he and the auditor are gone.</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"He's got it in for us   you know," the PFY murmurs.</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes, I know.

And the Voice Recalibration Application is missing too."   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I see," I answer thoughtfully,   gesturing the PFY over. "So what you're saying is that somehow, probably due   to the crash the helpdesk caused on the back-up server yesterday, all the voice-tailoring   of the user's dictation systems have disappeared." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"And don't tell me, the   install media is gone too?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes, how did you know?"   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"A lucky guess," the PFY   shouts. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Now tell me," I say, "there   must be another voice module apart from the 'plain English' one?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well that's the funny   thing." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"There's a module I've   never seen before.

The building is all but deserted as the company hosts its 'New Initiative W3' day for the workers - a disgusting event where the heads of the various departments report on the three wheres of existence - where we came from, where we are, and where we're going. <P> I notice that my overlay picture of a lavatory has been removed from the posters   in the cafeteria. Perhaps that's why the PFY and I have the dubious honour of   joining security in being the only staff not to get an invite. <P> It's surprising how bored an administrator can become without external distractions.   The PFY seems particularly melancholy now that there are no users to bug him.   A lesser man might be drawn to question his real feelings in the light of this   knowledge. The PFY and I however have larger fish to grill - over the boss's   under-desk heater as it happens. <P> Amazing what they'll do when you cover half the air inlet and disconnect the   thermal cut-out. <P> In no time we're tucking into a tasty lunch - and crispy too, thanks to the   PFY's discovery that by removing the safety cover you can place the food nearer   to the bare heating wires. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You know, it's funny,"   the PFY says as he gobbles the last of his fish buttie, "but in a way I miss   the users." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We should give Dr Robb   a ring." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Dr Robb, is the company   shrink.

"In fact I don't use any electrical appliances."   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"But what about the phone?   That's an electrical appliance of sorts isn't...." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">>CLICK "That's strange,"   the PFY comments. "He's hung up And what about that crap about not using electrical   appliances?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I know - sounds like neurosis   if you ask me. Sounds like he needs another dose of that shock treatment they   go on about." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What do you mean, another   dose?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh, nothing.

"I thought we'd realised that we needed the users?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Don't be stupid. I'll   never need a user while I have the Doom and Quake boxed set and the Internet.   And grilled fish for lunch of course. Speaking of which, did you put the safety..."   </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A scream from the boss's   office answers my question before the PFY can respond. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Whoops," says the PFY.   </font><P> <P><HR><CENTER>  <H2><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> While the PFY is busy     with his Tunnel-Monkey work, the BOFH is sorting out the e-mail system and     diverting complaints to sex lines... </font></H2></CENTER><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It's a tedious morning at Network Central so I while away the hours by getting the PFY to do some Tunnel-Monkey work checking the earthing straps on the cable trays in the comms risers. <P> True, it's a hot, cramped and pointless job, but it does give him a broader   view of the world of networking. And helps him remember that when I say "Don't   play with my laptop," I mean it. <P> The calls are coming in thick and fast this morning and without the PFY I   have to start screening them myself. The helpdesk has started giving out our   number to anyone who seems important, and since the boss fixed them up with   an exchange console, our usual ploy of changing numbers every day no longer   seems to work. <P> After a few calls I can see that there's a trend towards one single complaint,   so I 'screen' the rest of them by diverting the phone to an outside sex line,   then fire off an e-mail memo to the beancounters saying there's been a lot of   telephone abuse in that area recently, and perhaps they should investigate. <P> But unlike Wells Fargo, my mail does not get through. In fact it hardly ever   gets through. Not since the Boss, off his own bat, got our Systems predecessors   to 'Upgrade' the mail server with some 'fantastic' software which does everything   but drop a lipsticked kiss on the bottom of your personal e-mail. <P> Everything but deliver the bloody message that is. <P> I corner the Boss once more about this by pointing out the software's many   shortcomings. However, he gets evasive. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, it did cost an awful   lot of money - and besides, a lot of our Meeting Calendars are plugged into   it too!" </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> So it is that a few days   later the Boss is looking through the manual archive in the store for his mailer   guide when the PFY interrupts my dedicated labour with a question. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What're you doing?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Ensuring the return of   my beloved sendmail," I reply. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"How?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Ah, just helping the 'flash   mailer' software 'deliver' the boss's e-mail. The 'Visible Queue' screen is   actually quite good - it allows me to 'deliver' some messages personally." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"How?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, you grab certain   messages and drag them onto the Trash icon." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Which messages?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh, just one part of any   multi-part message." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I show him on the screen.   "See the Mail-IN queue? The Subject contains the sequence number of the part.   So you delete part 23 of 24 and let the other parts go through. It's driving   him insane. And, of course, I'm 'delivering' all of his outgoing mail altogether,   so he's having to send everything important by internal mail just to make sure   it gets there, never really knowing what's getting there and what's not." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, what he doesn't   know won't hurt him," the PFY mutters. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"That statement has never   proved accurate in my experience. For instance, I don't believe at this point   in time the Boss knows that the top step of the storeroom stepladder is very   loose..." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> We both listen intently   to the sound of an overweight manager plunging 5 feet into several large boxes   of lineflow paper. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> An hour later, as I'm reverting   our mailserver to my first choice (I think it was the 10 e-mail messages that   I'd claimed to have sent to Buildings Maintenance about stepladder problems   that swung it), the PFY comes over looking perplexed. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I don't understand why   we installed it..." he says. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Sigh. Just when you think   he understands, you realise that he's still out there somewhere, looking for   answers. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"As your position in the   company increases, your perceived responsibility increases, your actual responsibility   decreases and your understanding of the issues decreases as well," I explain.   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"So why did we buy it in   the first place?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We bought it because someone   thought it was a good idea, and no-one at managerial level knew it was crap."   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I think that's a little   cynical..." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I interrupt with a hands-free   phone call. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Hello?" the boss answers.   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Hi, I was just wondering   why you authorised the upgrade to the new Object Orientated Programming package."   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, it was your idea   - you said we'd run out of objects." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Of course. Thank you."   </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I ring off. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Point made?" I ask. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I still don't think..."   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Hello?" the Boss answers.   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"That graphics accelerator   I removed from your machine, why was that again?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Because it ... something   about the graphics travelling too fast?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Of course, I remember   now," I reply hanging up. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"But..." the PFY adds.   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No BUTs - it's them or   us. You can lead a boss to a decision, but you can't make him think." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Sigh. </font><P> <P><HR><CENTER>  <H2><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The company architect's     presence in the building creates an air of expectancy and pushes the BOFH     into a bit of bastardly trickery... </font></H2></CENTER><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> There's a feeling of excitement in the air that I haven't felt in a long time. The same sort of excitement that precedes the Xmas get-together when the yearly bonuses are handed out. (Recent years excepted, of course.) <P> The font of all joy becomes apparent almost immediately. The company architect,   usually only called in for "department refits" is on the premises. That in itself   is a surprise, as I don't remember hearing of a wave of redundancies. <P> This time, however, my perusing indicates that there's been no departmental   Axejob. (Sigh.) It must be something else. The Head of IT is sure to know. <P> The PFY, trained to respond to just this kind of situation, fires up the building   'topology monitor' and we home in on the 'Big Guy's' belt buckle - a chunky   slab of metal that could stop a scud, complete with 'tasteful' picture of a   rampant mermaid engraved into it - a gift from loyal staff. <P> And they say that quality never goes out of style. As luck would have it,   the PFY and I gained access to it prior to presentation and loaded it with the   sort of hardware that keeps civil liberties groups busy. <P> Some people just don't understand. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Do you think the belt   will work?" the PFY asks, just before activation. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Of course it will," I   remind him. "The bug is so sensitive it could pick up an ant farting at 10 paces.   Which reminds me, make a mental note to deactivate it an hour after lunch -   no point in overloading its circuits." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Meanwhile, the sub-miniature   microphone in the mermaid's eye hears all... </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Gentlemen," our Head begins,   in hushed tones to the assembled board. "As chairperson of the committee to   investigate expansion solutions, I've the following to report: first, this building   is expensive to rent; second, it's becoming too small for our purposes; and   third, it doesn't have the networking infrastructure to allow us to expand into   the 21st century. For these reasons, I have taken advice from certain quarters..."   he pauses, indicating, no doubt, a couple of board members known for their property   speculation, "and signed the company up for the occupation of a larger facility   at a waterfront location at a far more reasonable rent which we could move into   almost immediately." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"BULOOODY HELL!" the PFY   cries, echoing my own thoughts to the letter. "He can't be serious!" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Apparently so," I respond.   "And using his lack of technical expertise as a selling point too." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Lack?" the PFY blurts   "He's not completely stupid; after all, he was on that TV programme - what was   it, Beyond 2000?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Ah no, the TV programme   he was on was Beyond Help, a completely different documentary altogether. Had   a whole show on trainspotting apparently." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Within the hour, the Boss   is upon us, breaking the news, A-Z in hand. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We're moving," he cries   annoyed, indicating a spot on the river. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I only just bloody found   out!" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Best start packing," I   shout. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You mean... you're not   going to oppose the move?" he asks. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Why?" I ask incredulously.   "I can't wait! The chance to design a new and futureproof network." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"But what about access   to the city?" he sniffles. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Highly overrated - smog,   congestion. Give me river views anytime." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Me too," the PFY concurs.   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"But what about... all   the work you've done here?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"In the past. I'm looking   forward to the challenge of the future." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"But..." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"All right. Fifty quid   and I'll put the kybosh on it. What about you?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Twenty pints," the PFY   cries. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You can't be serious!"   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"All right then, we're   not serious. Let's get packing." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Uh... OK. But what are   you going to do?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, I'd tell you, but   then I'd have to strap a bulk eraser to your head and stick you to one of the   metal floor tiles." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You mean it's that secret?"   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Not really, I'm just curious   to see what would happen." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Taking the hint, the boss   takes his leave. I get on the phone to the company's head shark, a lawyer so   dodgy his business card's got someone else's name on it. I invite him down for   a little chat about that tenancy contract loophole we discovered ... in about   10 minutes. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Sure enough, the end of   the day finds the Boss in a giving mood. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I don't know how you did   it," he cries cheerfully, "but it's money well spent. How'd you get the head   lawyer to go for it - I thought he was one of the landlords?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh, he's quite reasonable   when you get him down to ground level," I respond. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh," The PFY blurts, "Speaking   of which, should I turn off the eraser?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Hmmm. Maybe not just yet.   Let's leave it a couple more hours." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It's true what they say,   you've just got to know how to communicate with these people... </font><P> <P><HR><CENTER>  <H2>    <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The BOFH and PFY are       hurt when they're left out of the games day ‚ but it's nothing that a mallet       and a spot of violence can't take care of... </font></H2></CENTER><HR><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> So the PFY and I are deeply   hurt when the CEO decides to ease the proles' building move disappointment by   holding an IT and clients 'games' weekend - complete with Murder Mystery Saturday   party - without the PFY and I. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Rumour has it our 'tame'   lawyer spilt the beans about the whole tenancy contract loophole deal before   departing to the relative safety of a rival company... </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> What hurts is that the   head of IT used one of our very own excuses on us - that the network always   needs someone on call because of the overseas offices, particularly now that   IT will be absent for the whole weekend. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Which is bollocks, as half   the offices couldn't call the International 24-hour helpdesk if it wasn't the   top right-hand button on their phones. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It's almost as if they   don't want the PFY and I socialising with people on a fun outing. As if they   don't trust us. Apparently the interest dropped off exponentially when the Murder   Party was announced. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Still, it's an ill wind   - it'll give us a chance to perform some disk- warranty checks (a couple of   whacks with a rubber panel-beating mallet that leaves no marks just before the   end of the warranty period.) You'd be surprised how many disks fail the tests   requiring a free replacement. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I'm checking we have all   the kit on hand on Friday afternoon when the boss breezes in. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Evening all," he cries   cheerily, obviously gagging to break some news to us. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Guess what I've managed   to wangle?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes?" I respond, without   enthusiasm. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You've been okayed to   come to the Sunday games - after you do some software installations in Personnel   of course," he says, handing me a list longer than the 'known bugs' of Windows   95. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Saturday dawns and, never   ones to turn down a challenge, the PFY and I pull out all stops to ensure that   the upgrades get done on time. In fact, we even have a little spare, which we   put to good use. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Monday comes, and I go   to work knowing full well I'm going to be burdened by a conversation with the   boss. Sure enough, he calls out to me before I can get to mission control and   gestures to his office which, from my angle, appears to have more than its usual   allocation of Personnel management in situ. The PFY is also on the scene, so   it's very cramped in the boss's office. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Simon," the boss starts,   "I've just been going over a number of complaints that Justin here has raised   about your conduct yesterday." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yesterday?" I ask, innocence   my new middle name. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"At the games? At Balesworth   Castle Grounds?" Justin snaps. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh yes! And you say there   were complaints?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes! You realise that   this was supposed to be a 'fun' occasion, where members of the various departments   could meet in a spirit of sportsmanship." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes, I did realise that.   In fact, I did my best to try every game even though some of them were quite   new to me." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"So it would appear. Justin   seems to believe that you may have been a little over-enthusiastic." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Really? I can't think   why. Can you?" I ask the PFY. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Not really." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What about the petanque   game?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The petanque game?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes, where you played   your ball from the rooftop?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh yes! Well I had to   - I got a helpdesk call on the cellphone and the reception on the playing field   was lousy. So, in the 'spirit of sportspersonship', I didn't want everyone waiting   for me to have my turn. Anyway, I don't believe there's anything in the rules   about what height you have to play the ball from." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Perhaps not, but pretending   to light a fuse on the castle's cannon before playing your ball didn't add to   your competitors' sense of well-being..." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It was only a bit of fun."   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Like the petanque ball   that dented the bonnet of Justin's coupÈ?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh, I just needed a little   fine-tuning on my aim," I cry, still going for the innocent look. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"And that would be the   same excuse you'll be using for the 'Hacky Sack' game?" he continued. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I admit I did get a little   enthusiastic," I reply, "which, combined with the angle of the sun, may have   led to some confusion." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Confusion...yes," Justin   hissed. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well at least I managed   to kick the sack." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You managed to kick a   sack. Unfortunately for Justin, the sack concerned is more commonly known as   a scrotum." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"As I said, the sun, me   not being used to steel toe-capped shoes..." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I might be able to accept   these excuses except it appears that neither of you performed the software installs   I asked..." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes we did," the PFY cried.   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"None of the machines are   booting!" Justin shouted, unable to restrain himself any longer. "They're just   sitting there." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I told you," I said to   the PFY "Those bloody hard disks were faulty." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Which brings me to this,"   the Boss sighed, holding up a piece of disk-testing equipment. "Anyone care   to tell me how this got into Justin's office?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"He's fixed the coupÈ himself   to save on insurance?" I offer helpfully. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The PFY and I settle ourselves   comfortably for the wailing and gnashing of teeth to follow... </font><P> <P><HR><CENTER>  <H2><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A US buyout results     in a visit stateside, a lesson in the zen of lift shafts and plenty of new     kit... all expensives paid </font></H2></CENTER><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It's a crisp Monday morning when the CEO pops into our offices to ask for a bit of a favour. The boss, nose always alert for the truffles of office kudos, creeps in. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I'd like you to rig up   the video conference stuff up so that I can give a quick speech to the entire   company" he requests. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You're not retiring, are   you?" the boss blurts, eyes on a prize WAAAAY above his station. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No, no" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"An early Easter message   to the troops, then?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No. The truth of the matter   is that we've been bought out. Lock, stock and Barrel" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"THE BLOODY JAPS!" the   boss cries. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No, no!" the CEO sighs,   "Anyway, with the world money situation, about the only other place it would   come from would be Amsterdam." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh thank goodness for   that!" the boss blurts, "I don't know a word of Belgian!" </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The things you hear when   you haven't got your nailgun... </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The day arrives and the   CEO spells it out for the masses around the world. An American conglomerate   looking for foreign investment stumbled across our well-doctored Annual Report   and liked what they saw so much that they bought the company. The news that   there are no plans for resizing is met with a collective sigh from the assembled   proles. For now, it's business as usual... </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Simon," the CEO mumbles,   away from the relative security of his executive en-suite for the second time   this week (a new record). "Just need you and your Man Friday to pop over to   the Mother company in the US for a week or so to see how they do their stuff.   Smart cookies over there apparently, all state-of-the-art palaver. Anyway, the   bosses there just want to go over and chin-wag with their techos. Hope you don't   mind..." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> An all-expenses paid junket   to the US...Hmmm. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, it would definitely   be helpful, but it'd take ages to ship the equipment over." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh, we'll fly you business   class and you can take it as luggage!" he cries. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I don't really think that   will QUITE cover the network analyser hardware and the..." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, I suppose we could   squeeze you both into First Class" he cries magnamimously... </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> And so it was that two   days and many, many first-class drinks later, the PFY and I are awaiting collection   in a holding cell at the port of entry into the US. Apparently they don't take   too kindly to heavy drinking at Customs, especially not when you use the "strange   customs" joke too many times. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Luckily, our parent company   actually does a bit of wheeling and dealing in the field and manages to spring   us from custody. After a night's rest, we're met by our tour guide - the boss's   equivalent in the mother company. He gives us a quick overview of their operation,   introduces us to the systems and network blokes, then beats a hasty retreat.   We're shown around the site and have to admit to being impressed with the equipment.   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It's certainly impressive,"   I mention to one of my counterparts as we're looking at their collection of   brand-spanking new kit. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, we like to keep   up with the times. Besides, a lot of the older stuff was damaged when we relocated   to the second floor." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Damaged?" I ask, smelling   professionalism lurking in the wings. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yeah, we're not exactly   sure how, but the lift doors opened when the lift wasn't there..." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Ah," I nod knowingly,   "and a laden trolley of equipment plunged down the shaft?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"THREE laden trolleys as   it happened - unfortunately, I was wearing the ear muffs that the company makes   you wear in the computer room and didn't hear the kit hit the bottom." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"How unfortunate," I sigh   meaningfully. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Not quite as unfortunate   as the boss not trusting us with his bonsai plants and carrying them to the   lift himself." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Where he subsequently   dropped them?" I ask, filling in the blanks as appropriate. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Actually no, he held on   to them all the way to the ground floor. Mind you, the paramedics did trample   them in their hurry to rescue him." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A week later, the PFY and   I are bailed out of a holding cell at Heathrow (what the hell, an opportunity   missed is an opportunity gone forever) and the next day make our report to the   boss and CEO. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"All their equipment is   miles ahead of ours! We'll need an extensive systems and networks management   upgrade! Worse still, our operations centre has a network latency problem because   it's so far from the satellite dish on the roof. We'd need to move at least   two floors up to cut the distance and reduce the delay. I'd suggest we move   in after we organise the purchase of compatible equipment through the systems   and networks guy over in the US head office once he's worked out what we need..."   </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> ...Meanwhile, on the other   side of the water, my counterpart is presenting his compatibilty proposal...   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"All their equipment is   miles ahead of ours...etc." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A couple of days on, I   get my cheque from the US office to buy some compatible gear... </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> My progress to Oddbins   is delayed only momentarily by the sound of a trolleyful of kit hitting the   bottom of a lift shaft. That's the PFY's dedication for you - it's all work,   work, work. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Good of the boss to lend   a hand moving his prized cactus plants... </font><P> <P><HR><CENTER>  <H2><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Translating engineer     excuses into non-fiction can be a difficult task ‚ but nothing is too tough     for The Bastard Bible... </font></H2></CENTER><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> So I'm putting some finishing touches to The Bastard Bible, or as the PFY and I refer to it, 'Everything your users ever wanted to know about systems and networks management but were too afraid to ask because they didn't want to spend a bank holiday weekend stuck in a chemical toilet.' <P> The PFY wanders over after logging a hardware fault on an old RAID cabinet   that's near the end of its serviceable life. Noticing my disdain, the PFY can't   stop himself: "You don't like engineers very much do you?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Not particularly. It's   such a crap paid job that all the good ones bugger off to private contracting   while all the crap - or new - ones get sent out to look after our gear." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It's not quite that bad,"   the PFY says, shaking his head. "They get the job done." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Time will tell." I don't   want to raise his hopes as I know that our maintenance contracting company tries   to reduce costs by religiously claiming the fault is software, not hardware.   When that fails, they'll attempt to 'repair' gear on-site using your tools to   disguise the fact that they don't actually have a workshop. That is, they're   operating from the back room of a minicab company. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> As expected, the engineer   arrives exactly at 11:53am, just in time to hook on to the crowd going out to   lunch. He wants to blend in with the rest of the department so he can get some   free food. Like company, like employee. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> After lunch the PFY and   I let him back into the computer room to see if he knows what he's doing. He   flicks a couple of switches on the RAID unit to see if any of them will make   the Disk-Fault light extinguish. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> When that fails - maybe   because the disk has a fault? - he comes up with his carefully considered diagnosis.   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Hmmm. That's interesting,"   he says. I direct the PFY's eyes to that phrase in the 'Engineer Speak' section   of the Bastard Bible: "I have no idea what's wrong." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"So the disk is faulty?"   I ask. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Could be, but I'll need   to get my service kit from the car." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The PFY reads the translation   to himself: "I need to get XXX from the car/van/courier," equals, "I'm going   to bugger off back to the office and hope the call gets re-assigned to another   engineer." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh, we've got one here!"   I cry, knobbling him completely. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh... great." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Now he's stuck. He's going   to have to open the cabinet up and have a poke around. Otherwise we'll know   he has no idea. I give him a clue by pointing at the dud disk in the unit. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"So I guess you'll replace   that?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It's possible," he responds,   still avoiding the commitment of having an opinion. "But I'd like to check it   over first." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> As I take my leave, he   prepares the unit for the hot‚removal with a hammer. A minute later he's back   in our office. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Have you got a bigger   hammer?" </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> At this stage I feel compelled,   if only for my personal sanity, to point out the quick release latches that   are preventing the disk's removal. He yanks the drive from its bay and brings   it into the control room for a once-over. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yeah, as I thought, it's   a dry joint on the logic board. I'll just re-solder it." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I'm about to ruin a piece   of your hardware," the PFY reads aloud. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Pardon?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Nothing." The PFY closes   the translation chart before the engineer can peer over his shoulder. "Just   talking to myself." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> He plugs our soldering   iron in, letting it melt the mouse pad he's laid it on. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We'll have it back up   in no time," he says happily. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It's about to become a   f***ing expensive paperweight," the PFY reads. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Pardon?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Nothing - just my Tourette's   Syndrome kicking in." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Before the soldering iron   can work its way through the mouse pad to the table top, I decide to take steps.   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Shouldn't you work on   that in the computer room to prevent possible thermal expansion /contraction   problems?" I ask. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> DUMMY MODE ON. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Duh... yeah... I was just   going to do that. Just making sure the soldering iron was working." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> He wanders back into the   computer room, then returns a minute later. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You don't have any solder   do you? I seem to have left mine in the car." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yeah, sure," the PFY replies,   handing over some of our stash. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Wait!" I cry. "You don't   want that - you want the solder with the flux core to act as a catalyst to the   soldering bond." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> DUMMY MODE IRREVOCABLY   ON. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I hand over some chunky   stuff that's more suited to plumbing than electronics, and the engineer smiles.   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Cool, I was just going   to ask for the catalystic stuff." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> He wanders off happily.   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What did you give him   that crap for?" the PFY asks. "It's horrible to use and always gives off tons   of smo..." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> His question is answered   as the computer room fire alarm triggers. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> We watch through the viewing   window for a while as the engineer fumbles with the Halon Hold-Off switch, which   some Bastard appears to have epoxy glued open. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Of course, we let him out   before he passes out. Just... </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Call me Mr Kind-hearted.   </font><P> <P><HR><CENTER>  <H2><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> When the boss and the     PFY both suffer from acute computer 'acronym dependence', it's time to visit     Harley Street to play in the traffic ... </font></H2></CENTER><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"...So I think the proposal for an ATM network to back up the FDDI backbone ASAP would be appropriate," the boss says. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I beg your pardon?"

I reply, deeply   troubled, "I think the boss is suffering from acronym dependence...It's where   a non-technical person over-compensates for the lack of intellect by..." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"...over-using acronyms   in conversation...And it's most often seen in managers and salesdroids who believe   that it gives the impression of computing competence," the PFY completes. "I   read your article about it on a bulletin board yesterday at lunchtime." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You read a bulletin board?   In your own time?" I ask, worried. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, yeah," the PFY responds   guiltily, "but I was only browsing while waiting for a picture to download from   Netscape." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Smut?" I ask approvingly.   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Uh...no, it was a photo   of the layout of the new laptop Pentium Pro motherboard...It's got this really   small profile and..." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Bloody hell!

"I'm talking about equipment here, routers and switches.

"Rule one is that they have, at most, a two-item stack limit. Mention   a technical term and they'll push it onto their mental stack. Mention another,   they push that up there as well. Mention yet another and they stack overload   and reboot. That is, they think about what they're going to do after work, how   sore their bum is, whether the marketing assistant knows her blouse is almost   see-through, and so forth." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"But then they'd be rebooting   all the time," the PFY says. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Afraid not. Rule one,   subsection B, deals with Stack Leakage. Technical terms leak from the stack   at about one per sentence." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Rule two of Management   Stack Theory is that the frame size on their mental stack is pitifully small   ‚ terms are compressed to fit into the available frame. I mention 'Disk seek   latency', they hear 'Disky Latex', 'Seek Latex', 'Disk Lazy', or something similar."   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"So they didn't get much   out of your presentation, is what you're saying? But they can't be that stupid,"   the PFY comments. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Oh, such innocence... </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Which brings me to rule   three of Manager Stack Theory," I cry. "After a manager reboots, Volatile Memory   is not zeroed, meaning that the contents are indeterminant. What the manager   is left with is a jumble of terms, which, after Manager Internal Logic has finished   with it, might become: 'Seek a see-through Latex Blouse'." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Ah," the PFY doesn't quite   believe me. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I can see that some form   of proof is required... </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Right, you apply my rules   to the following sentences.

Feeling slightly magnanimous towards the poor   blighter (after all, he has had a half-hour exposure to the boss's BO during   his introduction to the wonders of the photocopying machine - a dose of which   is usually fatal) the PFY and I don't put up the expected arguments to the boss's   encroachment on our territory. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Find him a machine to   work on will you - something that he can use to finish the development of the   Stores Project." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The Stores Project?"

"So you changed them?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yeah, but then he wanted   to try some different colours." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Of course he did. And   different fonts?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yeah." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What about the banner   - did he want to change that as well?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yeah, he wanted the company   logo on the centre and not on the left of the page." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Don't worry," the PFY   responds. "He'll want it back on the left tomorrow. Then on the right the next   day. Then the centre again..." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What am I going to do?"   he sniffles. "He didn't even want to see it in action." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"He just said it was fine   as it was and signed off your contract?" I ask knowingly. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yeah, that's it. All I   have to do is finish the aesthetics and my contract's over." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The demoralisation of having   his skill and expertise reduced to colours and fonts is obviously taking a toll   on the poor bloke. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yep, he doesn't care what   it does, so long as it looks good. Now you did say what we told you?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yeah. I said it was a   test version and not ready for release yet." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Good, which means he's   probably given the URL to the head of IT already." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"And he will have passed   it on to all the other heads of department," the PFY adds. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"But it's not even finished,"   he sobs, obviously upset at the thought of producing a buggy piece of code.   "I'd really like to make it work properly." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I can see this is a job   for a professional... </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Two days (and 5,000 rolls   of toilet paper delivered to the home of the boss and the head of IT) later,   our green and keen contractor is back working on the project. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I'm more than pleased to   see that his feedback basket is full of loads of design suggestions in the boss's   handwriting. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> He may well work out to   be all right after all... </font><P> <P><HR><CENTER>  <H2><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> There's nothing the     BOFH and PFY love more than a challenge ‚ except for violence.

He read how   good they are at clarifying..." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I switch off while the   benefits of PA-dom are explained in full.

(Just using   mental-cache wisely.) </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Of course. Now, how can   I help you, uh..." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"SONYA!" She snaps again.   "David wants me to audit the purchases he's signed off, to make sure they've   all been delivered." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"That would have been done   when the items were delivered," I've already sussed the boss's plan. Lacking   the bottle to find out if the PFY and I have been stealing the equipment we've   ordered, he's put some new blood on to it - someone who doesn't know what happened   to those who've gone before. Mind you, she could probably visit a couple of   them when she goes to see the boss. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"He thought it best to   make sure, so if you could just run off a printout of the orders..." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, I'd like to, but   unfortunately the database had a major disk fault, and we lost everything."   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"When was this?" She asks.   "Because I was only on the database 10 minutes ago and it seemed all right -   though I don't have access to the purchasing stuff." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"As a matter of fact it   just happened," I say as I hand the PFY the rubber panel-beating hammer we keep   especially for emergency disk failures. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What about a previous   printout from back-up?" She asks. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"All old printouts go to   security shredding services once they've been used, and the back-up system has   a tape jammed in its drive," I say, passing the PFY a suicide cartridge (full   of epoxy resin) as well. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"So there are no records?"   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The boss - David - has   printed records, and stores have an inwards goods printout. I'm sure you could   match those up - it's a bit of a job, but it'd all work out in the end." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A sniffle sounds on the   earpiece as she puts the phone down. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Something terrible has   happened!" the PFY cries, in mock horror, as he enters the room. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I'm sure it has," I reply,   as I plan the future. First things first, I dial in to the private institution   that's looking after the boss and figure a way into their server. 'Freud', the   third administrator password attempt I try, works... </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I make a couple of modifications   to the boss's patient record, changing 'history of violence' from 'nil' to 'extreme',   and, the real killer, changing his 'charge to' field from 'medical insurance'   to 'NHS' - guaranteeing that he'll be strapped into an iron bed in the budget   basement wing in no time at all. Sure, he'll be released back into the community,   'cured', after three ECT sessions, but what the hell! </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> He misses out on the expensive   NHS treatment when I find that it's not a quid per volt - NHS might have gone   as high as 10K were that the case... </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> While I'm at it, I toggle   the 'allow visitors' field - he'll probably need his rest. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What's the problem?" the   PFY asks curiously. "I thought we weren't nicking any kit this quarter?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We're not, but a careful   perusal of the books might find that a lot of kit has been paid for twice -   once by our department, and once by the department it was destined for. It was   when they were changing cost centres around and no one knew who was supposed   to be paying for things..." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"So you kept the dosh?"   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No, no - that would just   draw attention to ourselves. No, I got two lots of kit and used the second lot   to update all the machines in the data pool." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The same all-women data   pool that sent you the birthday card and cake?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Might be..." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"With the invite to birthday   drinkies?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes, that rings a bell   for some reason." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The day after which you   arrived to work, late, in a cab with a couple of the aforementioned women?"   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes, yes, I suppose so!   Was there a point to this?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh nothing," the PFY mutters,   wandering off. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The next day, who should   arrive at work but the boss. By his glazed expression I can tell he certainly   got the NHS's money's worth of electricity, which just goes to show that the   mental health situation isn't as bad as everyone says it is. As luck would have   it, he's in a signing mood, too - if you hold his hand and arm for him and stop   him dribbling on the ink before it's dry. So we write his PA a nice reference   letter, give her two weeks' notice, and order the data pool a whole set of gas-operated   chairs - what the hell, it's the PFY's birthday soon. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I just love happy endings.   </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> So much so, I plug the   boss's chair back into the 24 hour timer... </font><P> <P><HR><CENTER>  <H2><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The game's the thing     by which to humiliate the Boss but it serves him right for getting the Head     of IT1s fancy woman to do the shopping... war and peace as usual </font></H2></CENTER><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It is truly pathetic! Having successfully repelled the invasion of the PAs, I feel ready to<P> claim the peaceful spoils of war. <P> Until, that is, the head of IT, designer-coloured cellphone and laptop, brand-spanking-new   company convertible car, appoints the boss's former PA to the position of "executive   liaison officer". <P> I am sure that this has absolutely nothing to do with the long lunchtime rides   she takes<P> with him in the aforementioned convertible. It is easy to see how her previous   two<P> days' experience has her thoroughly versed in the ins and outs, so to speak,   of IT. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"She's excellent!" the   boss cries, defending his ex-assistant. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Excellent?" I cry. "She   couldn't count her bum cheeks and come up with the same</font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> number twice..." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"She must know something   about IT to get appointed!" the boss responds, ignoring</font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> my comments. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Of course...And how long   did it take her to get her desktop machine going again?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The power switch is quite   difficult to find!" he replies defensively, loyal as a terrier. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes - the switch on the   front of the machine is deceptively prominent..." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The boss realises that   this conversation is sinking faster than the Titanic and absents</font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> himself.

(scrabble scrabble) "...the necessity to re-engineer   Cobol-based Database Query Forms." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Now as far as I'm concerned,   there are only two ways we'll be re-engineering any of the crap written in Cobol,   and they are: </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A) With the "rm-rf" command,   except that the operating system of the era (before RSI [or the fear of dying   of old age before you'd got to the end of a command] was a worry) this translates   to: "DELETE/ERASE/NO CONFIRM [...]*.*;*" or, my personal preference: </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> B) With an axe. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Anyway, seeing as how I've   been busted, I figure I'm going to have to no-show at the boozer until the Boss   drifts off to sleep. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Quarter of an hour later   and I'm in the pub, chatting over the freshly polished nails of a systems safety   engineer. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"So what does a systems   safety engineer do?" I ask, engaging her immediately in geek-talk. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, it involves all   aspects of software and hardware safety. I deal with privacy and security as   well as software design and testing with the aim being to ensure that no person   of institution comes to harm - physically/mentally/ financially - from the operation   of a computer or its software. It's a very interesting role, as you have to   be constantly aware of." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> My mind clicks off as I   attempt to hide my distress from her - and not just because she feels users   are worth saving. The worst has just occurred to me. SHE IS THE ANTI-BASTARD!   </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Immediately I start edging   away from her to a point where I know we're not in any danger of accidentally   touching. I remember my theoretical physics well enough to know what happens   when matter and anti-matter collide... </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"So what do you do?" she   asks, "Well, I'm a systems and networks administrator." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"And what brought you to   the Y2K presentation?" she asks, expecting a response laden with altruism and   concern for users. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, I'm just here to   ensure that our users aren't affected by any potential problems that might occur   before, during and after the turn of the century..." I respond, simultaneously   hating myself for being such a brown-noser, while mentally congratulating myself   on a first class piece of spadework. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I just can't help myself.   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Really?" she gushes, happy   to find a kindred spirit among the masses of computing professionals she's undoubtedly   met in the past. "Oh yes," I cry, "You have NO IDEA the lengths my assistant   and I have to go to just to ensure that users get what they need." She's thinking   systems handholding, and I'm thinking of a swift kick in the unmentionables,   but as I said, it's unmentionable, so I let her keep thinking along those lines.   What the hell, those physics geeks might be wrong... We chat for a bit, and   then wouldn't you know it, like a bad smell on a northerly breeze, in blows   the boss. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> This can only mean one   thing... </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"There's no free lunch!"   he cries, disheartened. "Yeah, I thought I'd pop down here for one," I answer,   placating him with the offer of a lager, thus reinforcing the "bloody good bloke"   theme while simultaneously bearing in mind the boss's rating as a "one lager   to lift-off man". </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I enhance the effect with   a vodka top, which means he should be under the table inside 15 minutes. I get   back from the bar and the boss is overflowing with bonhomie at my purchase of   a beer. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> About halfway through his   pint I realise my fatal mistake. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Let's get wassisname down   here!" he cries, to no one in particular, rummaging around in his coat for his   mobile phone. He dials up the PFY and extracts a promise of his attendance.   BUGGER. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Having spoilt my chances   of a quiet 57 G&Ts alone with my guest, he continues on his trail of destruction.   "Great bastard this," he cries, bursting with affection for me. "Remember the   time that user asked for a hot spare disk, so you heated one up in the furnace   and dropped it in his lap?" I'm busy making lager-tipping motions in the background   when the boss lurches once more down memory lane. "Or that time you told that   accountant that his chair was picking up static so he'd have to earth it - AND   GOT HIM TO PLUG HIS CHAIR INTO THE LIVE TERMINAL! HA HA HA!" </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> So it's just me and the   boss by the time the PFY gets there. Mind you, the boss is only semi-conscious   by now, so it only takes about 10 seconds to fill the PFY in. I buy the boss   a parting drink then pour him, glass and all, into a taxi home. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I have to say, you took   that bloody well," the PFY says. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Forgive and forget," I   cry magnanimously. "Besides, just about now he's going to figure out that his   drink isn't lager." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Number ones?" the PFY   asks </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Don't be disgusting!"   I cry, offended. "It's a warm fish milkshake - just the thing for a queasy stomach..."   </font><P> <P><HR><CENTER>  <H2><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A newcomer named Sharon,     a safety retrofit and a GPS transmitter leaves the BOFH on course for sipping     tequila in the sun... </font></H2></CENTER><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes, we've already met," the newcomer announces, as she enters Mission Control with the boss. "At the Y2K thing last week. Don't you remember? I met you at lunch." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"My memory of events is...a   little hazy," the boss burbles. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes," I interrupt, "unfortunately   it appears that he was set upon by an angry taxi driver after dropping two pints,   a plate of chips and a fish milkshake on to the front seat of a cab after the   event. By way of his stomach." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Be that as it may," the   boss cries, seizing back the mantle of the conversation. "Sharon here rang and   offered to check out our systems for potential risks - you know, company liability,   software and hardware oversights that may lead to injury or other accidents,   overall security, and so on." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> How bloody thoughtful of   her. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Anyway," the boss continues,   "I'm sure you'll give her any help she requires. OK, time we were moving on   to the next stop, which is the head of our department." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The boss and our new computing   safety consultant wander off in the direction of the head's orifice while the   PFY scurries over. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What does it mean?" he   asks, well aware of the part the boss played in alienating me from Sharon's   good books at our last meeting. Thanks to him, getting back into Sharon's good   books would require spadework of back-hoe proportions. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I'm not sure," I respond,   "but I think it means trouble." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The next day my words are   proved true when Sharon's analysis of the site accident logs points one or two   bloodstained fingers in the direction of Systems and Networks. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"These things are supposed   to be fitted with earth leakage detectors," she cries, investigating the power   points of the serviceman's workbench which have sent more than one unfortunate   engineer off to the sick bay for some burns cream. (While the PFY and I rifle   through his toolkit, of course.) </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Ah, no, we use a different   leakage detector for this," I say, pointing at a faceplate on the bench. "Faeces   and urine - cuts the power the moment someone loses control of their bodily   functions." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"That's ridiculous," Sharon   cries "And anyway, you can't test it." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I test it every month,"   the PFY cries indignantly. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"He certainly does," I   concur. "He downs a jar of pickled onions then tests the desk when his digestion   says so." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Having no comeback for   this one, Sharon moves on to investigate how the freight elevator came to be   on the 6th floor when a trolley full of user equipment was pushed through the   doors on the 5th floor by the PFY. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I could say it was standard   procedure to stop the boss offering our services as porters, but instead murmur   something unconvincing about PLU controllers being affected by spikes. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> By the end of the day Sharon   has reached the conclusion I desire - our kit needs a safety retrofit. That,   combined with the glossy mags on 'Systems Safety' that the Boss discovered in   his briefcase (outlining the benefits of the equipment produced by a corporation   in the US), is more than enough to hint at junket time. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I don't think that is   at all necessary," Sharon responds, upon hearing the boss's plan. "Everything   we need can be sourced locally." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We should investigate   all options," the boss cries, not inclined to miss out on a junket to the States.   </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> According to plan the boss   attempts to add credibility to his junket by suggesting that we all go "to cover   all technical bases". </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> And the boss does know   best. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The plane lifts off and   the PFY and I get into the drinks ASAP while Sharon wanders up to business class   to curry some more of the boss's favour. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I don't get it," says   the PFY. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"SOP for a boss," I respond.   "If you want something, get it for someone else 'for technical reasons' then   it looks that much more legitimate if you get yourself one. Cellphones, laptops,   you name it!" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What are we going to do   when we get there?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I plan to drink tequila   at a beachside bar." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I don't think there are   beaches in Ohio." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Ohio?" I cry, "We're not   going to Ohio. Not after the hijack anyway." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You're going to hijack   the plane?" the PFY hisses. "You're not serious?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Deadly." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"But..." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh don't worry, there's   no gunplay. Just track one of this CD," I murmur calmly, holding up my portable   CD player. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It's a CD player!" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Ostensibly yes, but also...   a mini GPS transmitter." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You're screwing with the   plane's guidance system?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I prefer the term 'having   a meaningful encounter'. This little baby will shortly start pumping out some   low-wattage GPS information - information the plane will use to get its flight   path. And, over the course of the journey, the information will deviate slightly   - because if I do it all at once the pilot might notice." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You'll never get away   with it," the PFY whispers discouragingly. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Of course I will. Have   I ever steered you wrong?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Uh, last week when you   told me the power was off when I was replacing the fuse in that rack. The week   before when you told me that all the ducting has door handles on the inside,   so it would be all right to shut the door." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I let you bloody out,   didn't I?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"After you'd drunk all   the lager I'd found in the boss's locker." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> And so it is that I'm sitting   in a South American bar, drinking tequilas while the boss tries to get us a   return flight to civilisation. Thanks to the super-spadework I put in when we   almost ran out of fuel because of the extra miles, Sharon is my new best mate.   </font><P> <P><HR><CENTER>  <H2><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> To escape the boredom     of routine, the BOFH volunteers to man the Helldesk. But does he still have     his special touch with the users? </font></H2></CENTER><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It's a quiet afternoon when the boss slips in unobtrusively and shuffles over to my desk. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Just want you to know   that I sorted out that little Helpdesk roster mix-up," he mentions quietly.   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What little Helpdesk mix-up   ?" I ask. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh, some practical joker   had written your name in the </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> roster to cover the Helpdesk   during their team building week." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes, that was me. Tomorrow   from midday till five wasn't it? I'm quite looking forward to it." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Ah!" the boss cries, no   doubt ducking off to press the speed-dial button for the company's insurance   broker. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The Pimply-Faced Youth   is obviously confused about this - there's nothing in the Helldesk area left   to steal because we did all that the last time security had its CCTV system   repaired. The truth of the matter is that I'm bored. Bored, bored, bored. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Heeding the advice that   a change is as good as a rest, I've signed up for a tour of duty at Idiot Central.   Besides, I want to know if I still have what it takes to deal with users on   a routine basis. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The next day dawns and   after lunch I head directly to the Helldesk to do my best to, I mean for, the   users. To be honest, it's not half as bad as I'd expected - things are pretty   quiet. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In the end I put the phones   back on the hook, and three lines light up immediately. I pick one at random   and answer it. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Hi, look, my machine's   smoking a little, and there's a burning smell. It was really noisy this morning   when I turned it on, so should I turn it off?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No. No need to worry -   we had a little bit of equipment fail in the comms room this morning, so it's   probably just the smoke and the smell coming down the lines." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Is there anything I should   do?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Not really, I'd just shut   your office door and go to afternoon tea early until the smoke clears - it'll   probably take an hour or so." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Hey, hang on, why isn't   it affecting the other machines?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Because you're on the   hot back-up server for your department, the one that got too hot, as it happened."   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh, of course I am!" he   gushes, gasping thanks and ducking off for an early break. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Now that I'm on limited   time (till the fire alarm and sprinklers cut in) I take the last two calls as   quick as I can). </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Hi," a secretary from   PR chirps, "every time I try to send e-mail my program comes back and says something   about a DNS thingy." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Was it something like   'DNS look-up error'?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yeah...I think so..."   she mumbles. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh dear." I sigh. "I'm   really sorry." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What is it?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You mean you don't know?"   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No, what?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well DNS stands for Database   of Names and Salaries." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I don't understand." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, if it can't look   you up to send your e-mail, it must mean you've...been fired.

I ask, playing   a hunch based solely on the fact that the guy concerned wears babe-magnet labelled   clothes and drives a convertible. And he's a loud-mouthed flashy git at staff   functions. Not that I'm jealous... </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"But I couldn't make it   because I had to arrange my bank payments!" she sniffles, falling for it hook,   line and sinker. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well," I respond kindly,   "for what it's worth it was good working with you...unless of course..." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Unless what?" "Well, you   could go and see the complaints officer in personnel and say that he threatened   your job unless you...you know." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Unless I what?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Checked out his firmware,   so to speak." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What!" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well it's up to you. If   you wait till you're fired they'll just think you're making excuses. But if   you pre-empt it, and mention nothing about the DNS stuff they'll think your   accusations are true." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Do you think it would   work?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I would think so. It's   happened before. You were just one of the lucky ones..." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I suppose you're right.   OK, I'll do it. Thank you very much for your advice." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Don't mention it." I respond,   moving on to caller three while gesturing to the PFY so he can record the head   of PR's "resignation" later in the afternoon. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Hi, my Linux box won't   seem to mount a CD in it. It says that it must be mounted read-only.

No, not some trivial contest like 'guess who can get the most laxative into the other team's water cooler without being noticed' - although that's fun too, especially when you have a contact put it in at the factory. This is a game of champions - Robowars! <P> The Pimply-faced Youth and I are competing against Research and Development   in an annual contest of skill and technology. The rules are simple: both teams   enter one or more robots into the competition - robots which must find their   way out of a fairly simple maze constructed of passages and rooms in the sub-basement   of the building. <P> The PFY is particularly excited as this is his first time in the competition. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"So this is a yearly event?"   he asks, helping me put together our mechanical entrant. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Since last year, yes."   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I don't remember it."   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No, I think you were in   Mr Happy mode at the time." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"On a jolly." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh. How did we do?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, as far as I was   concerned, we'd won fair and square - none of R&D's seven robots were left,   however, there was a bit of a protest lodged about my robot." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Why?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Aaaaahhhh, because it   was basically the boss with a car aerial strapped to his back, blundering around   in the basement trying to find his new laptop." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"And he won?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yeah, there wasn't a laptop   and when his enthusiasm waned I switched the lights off and the fire alarm on,   and he picked up speed dramatically." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"And what was their protest?"   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, there were two actually   - the first being that the boss running blindly around caused the destruction   of most of the competition (which, incidentally, helped us win the demo-derby   event by default) - and the second being that the boss wasn't a robot." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"So what happened?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, I showed them that,   to all intents and purposes, he was a robot - he had a limited and very simple   instruction set; you have to punch information into him and without it he can't   think for himself..." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I see. So why don't we   enter him this year?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Ah. Well, the restrictions   are somewhat tighter now.

My thinking   is that the bigger the robot, the more chance it has of still being mobile at   the end." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"So you're using a machine   rack laid on wheels?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes: a) It won't attract   much undue attention in the basement before the competition, and b) The rules   say it has to be battery-powered, and I need quite a lot of power to keep the   circular saw blades spinning, and c) It's a four foot-long steel chassis. It's   going to make it through the demo-derby - especially considering the largest   of the opposition robots comes to just over axle height on it." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Where are you going to   get all the batteries to run it?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh, I whipped those out   of the UPS last night." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Didn't anyone notice?"   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No, I chucked it into   bypass mode - not even a glitch. Anyway, all that remains now is for me to install   the polisher board with its bastardised maze-solving program, add the batteries   and chuck in a little ballast..." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Magic!" </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Three nights later, the   R&D boys are down in the basement setting up their robots while the PFY and   I sit around on ours. Smart money seems to be centred on a small robot nicknamed   "Reggie" because of its rapid cornering ability. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Actually, I think they've   got a point," the PFY mumbles, seeing a warm-up demonstration. "It's much quicker   to corner than this thing will be." </font><P><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Au contraire!" I respond.   "You're forgetting two things I didn't tell you about; one: with the 20 UPS   batteries and the four-wheel, rare-earth-element-magnet motors on this baby..."   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"five..." the starter counts   down. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"...it's got phenomenal   acceleration itself..." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"four..." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"But it's still going to   be a pain to corner!" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"three..." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"That was point two: with   all the weight inside that solid steel chassis..." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"two..." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"one..." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It would be a waste of   time cornering in the first place..." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Go!" </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Ten minutes later the PFY   and I are at the pub. Admittedly, the plan of driving straight through walls   wasn't one of the more orthodox ways of solving mazes, but it proved successful   nonetheless. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Who'd have thought the   robot would run amok in demo-derby mode and circular saw through the mains cable?"   I ask the PFY. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Who indeed?" the PFY asks,   fingering the prize money that the R&D blokes were too busy to collect in their   panic... "It could have chased R&D around the building..." </font><P> <P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Got to save some surprises   for next year..." </font><P>&nbsp;<P align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="Bastard1998-2.html">Bastard   1998-2</a></font>
