Possibly too   quiet - The kind of quiet you get when you shove a thick chunk of copper wire   in a circuit breaker, a nail in the phase circuit breaker and a bolt in the   floor circuit breaker... then drop a screwdriver down one of the ventilation   holes of the mainframe's power supply. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I make my way carefully   through the emergency-lit computer room to my office, my only detour being a   quick circuit breaker replacement tour and a stop at the bin to drop off a badly   scarred screwdriver. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I always prefer to start   the year off with a bang - or, to be more precise, a series of loud hums, a   crackle or two, and a muffled BOOM from the sub-basement. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> After all, it's just good   manners to let the great unwashed know just who's still at the helm of this   operation. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The PFY, meantime, is on   holiday, exercising his Christmas bonus to its maximum potential. After all,   it's only a matter of time before the Boss realises that there's a duplicate   of his credit card out there (again) and calls up the card company. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I did my bit for the PFY's   R&R by pushing the Boss's latest credit card statement, envelope and all, into   the shredder. Apparently he was under the misguided impression that receiving   mail at work is far safer than getting it at his dockside apartment drop box...   a mistake that's likely to cost him. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Speaking of the Boss's   mail, it's about time to distribute all his waylaid Christmas vendor freebies   among the IT troops in a manner not altogether unlike a modern day IT Robin   Hood. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What? Is that it?" a particularly   ungrateful antipodean contractor (who couldn't find his bum with a mirror and   a torch without a 1:1 scale map) asks after I hand him a bottle of red wine   that has better disinfectant than drinking properties. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Sorry?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It's a little, er, cheap,   isn't it?" he sniffles. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The things you hear when   the PFY isn't around with a nailgun. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Gee, sorry Mike!" I cry.   "I guess it's not like home where you get your pick of the flock for the night   as a Christmas bonus." </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> He lets the slur pass,   and grudgingly accepts the bottle, not realising just how well I remember the   time, after an agency knees-up, when he dropped me off at the farthest tube   station from my destination...three minutes AFTER the Tube stopped running.   </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Trusting no one, he stashes   the bottle in his desk-side footlocker, giving me the chance to stuff a large   piece of foam packing over the cooling inlet at the back of his desktop machine.   </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Thermal overheating time   bomb set, I wander off to distribute more New Year cheer. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> And not a moment too soon,   as the power is restored and the building springs back into life. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> When I've run out of blocks   of foam and cheap bottles of wine, I grab some of the good stuff and go on my   REAL goodwill rounds, dropping off gifts to the telephone operators, the cleaning   staff, and, lastly, the building maintenance guy. Know what palms to grease   and when - that's my motto. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Having ensured that no   one's going to investigate my long-distance phone bill, find the Boss's shredded   credit card statements or wonder what's protected by the Armageddon-proof lock   on the door marked 'Plant Room No3' in the basement, I return to my office.   </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> As luck would have it,   the Boss is waiting for me there with an annoyed expression on his face. It's   only a 'generally-annoyed' expression, which means that he's probably not found   out about his credit card yet, let alone me calling up his credit company and   cranking his limit up so far he'd get nose bleeds just thinking about it. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What's this about you   blocking up the cooling vent of Mike's machine?" he asks. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Bastard! </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh, that - it's not sponge,   it's...noise damping material." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"?..." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Noise damping - the material   has a gaseous porosity which allows air flow but reduces sound output by a factor   of around 10 decibels per megalitre of vacuum-rated European Standard air."   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Err, really? So it's just   to cut down noise?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Of course!" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Hang on a minute!..."   </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I suppose it was a little   too good to be true... </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Why haven't you installed   any on my machine?" </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I don't believe it... </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh, I was just getting   round to it - your one is in that old monitor box over there." </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> He ferrets around in the   aforementioned box before pulling out a bit of packing. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"This? It's a bit of machine   packing." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No, it's a sound-reducing,   air-cleaning filter." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Then why has it got 'recycle   this packing carefully' printed on the side of it?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Because... it was packed   in old newspaper and they couldn't print over the top of it." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh... so how do I use   it?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, you make sure that   it's hard up against the fan inlet so that no, er, 'unfiltered' air can get   through." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Right, well, I'll let   Mike know then," he burbles as he wanders out to destroy his machine. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No, no!" I cry. "Leave   that to me - I'll sort him out." </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> And sort him out I will.   </font><p> <HR><Center>  <HR>  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>BOFH '99.</B> Hooray for   Payday. Or maybe not..</font>  <HR></Center><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Thursday. Pay Day. I love   Pay Days. In fact, work is always better on a pay day. People are nicer, complaints   are rarer, bank managers are friendlier - a guy could get used to this. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A bastard, however, could   lose the touch - that finely honed reflex that enables him (or her) to sort   the wheat from the chaff (user-wise). Complacency is the enemy. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Still, the brown envelope   containing a cheque is a useful reminder of what we do this for. Smiling happily,   I fumble with the self-adhesive seal on the envelope (the glue must be the same   stuff they use to hold tiles onto the space shuttle), before losing my patience   and ripping the envelope open from the other end. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Ahhh!, The smell of a freshly   printed cheque...the feel of it as it slips out of the protective environment   of brown paper. The temporary but overpowering feeling of goodwill for all things   beancountery as I note the aesthetically pleasing sight of my company's name   laserprinted on the top line, right above the amount of...WHAT THE HELL!? </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> THE THIEVING BEANCOUNTER   BASTARDS HAVE UNDERPAID ME! </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I have another look, just   to make sure I've got it right. "The beancounters have underpaid me!" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You're joking!?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I'm not! Look, they've   rounded down the amount!" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"By how much?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"27p!" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Hang on, you're going   to maim someone - possibly permanently - over 27p?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It's not that it's 27p,   it's the principle of the thing. STEALING from me! It's unheard of! It's the   thin end of the wedge - before you know it, they'll be riding the lifts again.   They'll be questioning your expense claims, talking to you about business plans   at lunchtime, and..." </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> About 10 minutes later   I come to, with a rather nasty bruise on my head and a pain in my side. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Sorry about that," the   PFY calls from behind the door of the computer room, waving one of our low-output   (aka 'warning') cattle prods. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> He must have zapped me   while I was under the influence of theft-crisis. "That's OK," I respond, "perfectly   acceptable under the circumstances." </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I go to let myself into   the computer room to assure him there are no hard feelings, only to find my   access card's been given 'lock-out' status. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Sorry about that, too,   but you know what you get like," the PFY calls through the safety glass. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Of course!" I cry "No   harm done," as I sneakily reach for my special reserve access card, noted in   the database as a 'Fire and Civil Emergency' access card, which no one but me   knows exi... </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Got that one, too..."   the PFY murmurs apologetically. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> You've got to give him   credit, he's a chip off the old block. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I move away from the door   to see if he's going to come out when he thinks it's safe, but he's not that   stupid, either. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Desperate times call for   desperate measures. I set my rubbish bin on fire, then reverse the direction   of the office ('remodelled') air-conditioner so that it's blowing air into the   computer room instead of stealing air from it. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The halon 10-second warning   goes off and the PFY rushes to the hold-off switch - the real one (disguised   as an intercom pager button) - and not the decoy we use to frighten contractors.   </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I have him right where   I want him. While the smoke detectors still sense smoke the halon system is   still activated. While he holds the button down, the halon countdown is paused.   Currently at seven seconds... </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I hold the rubbish bin   up to the viewing window and throw in some more paper and a back-up tape (to   keep it nice and smoky) so the PFY can see I'm serious. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Out of earshot, he scribbles   a quick note on the wall. "You could be right, 27p is an insult!" </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Smiling, I pour coffee   into the bin to extinguish the flames, then sit down at my desk. The PFY emerges   from the computer room once the halon clear has been signalled. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"So, what are we going   to do?" he asks. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, I thought some form   of example has to be made. Firm - but not, of course, brutal." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You mean chilli sauce   in the eye-rinse bottle, laxative in the water fountain or glue on the bog seats?"   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well..." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"All three?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Warmer..." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"'Route their traffic via   the 3-Phase mains 'network'?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Almost there..." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Put indelible dye in the   rooftop water reservoir and trigger the sprinkler system on their floor?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes...to all of the above."   </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> And so it was that half-an-hour   later, the PFY's up a ladder, pouring a crimson cement dye concentrate into   the reservoir, when...BDZZZT!! </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> To his credit, the PFY   makes no sound as the cattle prod takes effect. Apart from the splash of course.   </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> After I've fished him out,   I disable his card, the halon system and the card known to the database as 'Installation   Card (Disabled)'. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> What goes around comes   around. </font><p> <HR><Center>  <HR>  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>BOFH '99.</B> Disaster   Recovery Blues..</font>  <HR></Center><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The boss is going on about   Disaster Recovery again, like the company's going to go to the wall if one of   the buildings collapses in an earthquake or something. My comment that an earthquake   during work hours might actually improve the company's performance did not generate   the expected chuckle of assent. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> One more for the seismic   therapy in other words. And, as part of his enquiries, he wants to inspect all   our DR planning and see just how well prepared we are for the eventuality. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I could tell him the truth,   which is that we're about as prepared for disaster as Butch Cassidy and the   Sundance Kid, but that would cause a lot of very unnecessary concern. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Not to put too fine a point   on it, I told him a load of old bollocks. Certainly enough to satisfy middle-management   types in any case: "Oh well, we're completely prepared with off-site media and   media inventories - back-up recovery plans, disaster recovery agreements with   hardware manufacturers, along with three 'cold-site' venues in our distant offices   to run up a recovery system in about 36 hours, give or take half a day or so,"   I burble. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Add to that our redundant   cabling links, agreements for emergency cable and satellite service from the   major carriers, the network side of the recovery would be the simplest part.   The slowest bit would be reading the tapes into the various server machines.   Client and desktop machines would be added on an as-needed basis, depending   on the employees concerned and their immediate importance to the company plan."   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Excellent!" the boss cries,   eyes shining with delight. "Well, I suppose all that's left is for a quick tour   of the facilities!" </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> So now I'm up a thinwire   without a terminator. The boss is bound to find out sooner or later that it's   all bollocks and demand to know why. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The PFY notices my air   of resignation (to having to listen to the boss rabbit on about 'professional   integrity' and not job evacuation) and asks what the problem is. I fill him   in on all the sordid details. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We could just take him   to one of the cold site centres and tell him that they all look like that, then   get the off-site media bloke to say that they don't permit site visits," he   suggests. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The media guy might work,   but the cold site's a goner." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Too cold to be fired up?"   the PFY asks. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No, too hired out to other   tenants." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What?!" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, they're normally   right in the heart of the business districts. So I usually rent the space to   some other company and pour the dosh to a more deserving project - in this case   boosting the bandwidth of the outgoing network connections." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Uncharacteristically altruistic   of you," the PFY murmurs. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yeah well...But it's all   over now. He's bound to..." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Not necessarily!" the   PFY shouts with satisfaction, with what looks like a glimmering of a plan in   his eye. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Two days later, the boss   joins me in the back of a limousine for the trip to our site. "Bloody dark in   here," the boss mutters. "Can't even see out the windows." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes," I ad lib. "This   is a loaner from the Media Storage place - they take no precautions as they   have important clients." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh," the boss utters smugly,   self-importance boosted. "So, where are we going?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We're going to the nearest   site, which is about two hours away. I thought we'd tour one site a day if that's   OK with you." </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Two hours later we glide   down a ramp into the sub-basement parking area of the first DR centre. I help   the boss into a newly refurbished freight elevator (security reasons) and we   drop a level to the DR centre. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Reminds me of somewhere,"   the boss mumbles, slightly more confused than his normal operating level. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We got the DR centres   to look familiar so that relocation and orientation is easier on the staff."   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Really? That's quite a   good idea!" </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> We enter the DR computer   room and have a quick look around. "It's a bit quiet isn't it?" the boss asks.   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, cold sites are typically   only fired up in an emergency - mainly to save power and maintenance costs."   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Of course." </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The rest of the tour goes   smoothly and we make our way back to the office. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Where to tomorrow?" the   boss asks. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I thought we might leave   early and get to the Welsh Centre...pick you up at your place at 6am if that's   OK." </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Once the boss has gone   I tap on the driver's window. The PFY's visage appears as the smoked glass descends.   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Wales tomorrow," I murmur.   "Move the kit around a bit, put some Welsh maps up with coloured pins at strategic   points, and leave a box of leeks in the freight elevator. Oh, and for Pete's   sake, get a bit more of the city in, will you? Two hundred times round the block   is just asking for trouble!" </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Right, now to translate   some machine names into imitation Welsh for the boss's edification (i.e Clomputhenay,   etc.). </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> This DR Stuff - it's all   work, work, work! </font><p> <HR><Center>  <HR>  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>BOFH '99.</B> Back to   the Helldesk?!?</font>  <HR></Center><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> However, there is little   philanthropy in this act, but more opportunity for a little hell-raising. I'm   so bloody nice, I deserve a medal! Out of the kindness of my heart, I have volunteered   to look after the helldesk in their time of need. It appears that thanks to   winter chills and staff holidays, the helldesk is chronically understaffed.   </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The PFY, bless him, is   cut from the same selfless cloth as myself and has offered to keep watch for   - I mean, assist me in looking after - the users. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Nothing much has changed   since we were here last. Well, it is daytime now, and I'm not carrying a sack   and a crowbar, but apart from that it's pretty much the same. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"This," I say to the PFY,   "is a telephone. You've seen people talking at them before, and now it's your   turn to give it a go." </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I ignore the PFY's hand   gesture which, under normal circumstances, would denote something to the effect   that "you have a sexually fulfilling relationship with your right hand" (which,   incidentally, I have interpreted as, "I am in desperate need of a damn good   kicking - perhaps you could see your way clear to organising me one in the near   future?") and get back to the job at hand. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You take lines 1, 3 and   5. I'll take 2, 4, and 6," I snap. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What? I thought we were   just going to divert all the calls to the Religious Thought-for-the-day message   line and rifle through their desktop machines for anything useful or incriminating!"   the PFY whines petulantly. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"A complete waste of time,"   I respond, "since I swapped all the good hardware with the shite stuff in the   comms-closet PCs to allow us to have a multi-user Quake II challenge from any   floor in the building." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You mean we can't even   play Quake on these things?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Afraid not. These machines   would be lucky to load ANSI graphics, let alone SVGA stuff." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"But..." the PFY pouts.   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No buts, we're going to   use our time profitably by getting to know our users once more. We've been far   too isolated from them this year - it's time for us to renew our ties!" </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> All this altruism is making   me feel a little queasy, but I gulp down the nausea and continue. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"RIGHT!" I shout. "Synchronise   excuse calendars, page 47, Hypotropic Osmotic Leeching." </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The PFY's eyes glaze over   momentarily as his attention-span safety cut-out trips, but he's back with me   in record time. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I'll just call it H.O.L,"   he murmurs, blinking rapidly as full consciousness returns. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Alrighty! Let the games   commence!" I cry. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Games? What games?" the   PFY asks. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You'll find out..." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I still don't know why   the boss didn't veto this," the PFY cries. "I didn't think he'd be stupid enough   to go for it." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"He wasn't," I answer cheerily,   "but he's been transferred to the Leeds office after a little incident earlier   in the week." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh yes?" the PFY asks,   curiosity piqued. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It was tragic." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"REALLY?" the PFY asks,   interested. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It appears that he may   have disgraced himself at that Harassment Procedures meeting that the US people   made all management types go to." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The one they imported   all those Huggy Feelies from head office for?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"He didn't say he thought   it was a How-To course?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No - apparently he had   something with him at the meeting that didn't go down well. In fact, that's   perhaps the best way to describe it." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You mean he had a..."   </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Apparently so.

"Hello, how can I help?" I ask in tones that can   only bode goodwill to all comers. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Hi, my machine keeps losing   the time, and my workmate says that it's probably the battery inside the machine!"   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"How old is the machine?"   I ask. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Three months." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Normally batteries don't   fail that soon," I respond. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I think the problem may   be that when your machine boots, it sets its time from our network time server,   only it's setting the wrong time because your time zone setting isn't GMT."   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well... &gt;clickety&lt;   &gt;clickety&lt; YES! It's set to Winnipeg! Where on earth is Winnipeg?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I believe it's in Canada,"   I respond knowingly. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Thanks very much!" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You're welcome!" I respond,   then hang up. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The PFY meantime, is gobsmacked.   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What was that?" he cries   in disbelief. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh, didn't I tell you?   That's the game. Winner takes all - first one to crack has to shout the beers   on Friday." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It's not much of a game.   Doesn't sound like much fun!" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What, and MONOPOLY IS?!"   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, no, but it's not   that sort of game!" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I think you're CHICKEN!"   I taunt. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No way!" the PFY shouts.   "You're used to it." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"All right, I'll take line   1 as well, giving me twice as many potential callers. Happy now?" </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The PFY nods, then grins   as Line 1 lights up. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Perhaps I've bitten off   a little more than I can chew... </font><p> <HR><Center>  <HR>  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>BOFH '99.</B> Omniscience?</font>  <HR></Center><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> So I'm in a downtown cafe,   grabbing a moment's respite (well, a couple of hours, let's be honest) from   the maddening crowd - with Mission Control's phone diverted to my unlisted cellphone   number, when the phone rings. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Hello, Networks and Systems,"   I cry pleasantly, in the manner of one still competing for the 'who can be the   nicest to users' competition... </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> ...which I'm certainly   not, having won off the PFY by performing a lot of 'space reclamation' on the   data servers then leaving sound-byte constructed voicemail messages 'from the   PFY' claiming all responsibility and no remorse for doing it. The ill-will towards   him at the moment is such that the Boss thought it best he take a little time   off. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Where are you?" the Boss   asks, voice muffled by the sounds of traffic from outside my current location.   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"In the machine room!"   I cry, as indignantly. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Really? Then what's that   noise in the background? I can hear cars!" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes, yes, that's just   the Multimedia Demo package that starts every time this new bloody server gets   booted," I ad lib. "I'd pull the speakers out but we need them for initial de-bug   sounds." </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> My output bullshitometer   is registering three out of 10, so I feel that this excuse will probably suffice   for the boss. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh," he responds, confirming   my suspicions. "Well I need to get into the computer room as I'm showing some   new employees our computing operations. So if you could just pop round and let   us in..." </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Now call me old-fashioned,   but the LAST thing I want is the Holiest of Holies exposed to drooling half-wits   with no idea of how or why computers work. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Being a forward-thinking   type, I'd planned for the access eventuality by locking out both Mission Control   and the Computer Room from all but myself. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I'm afraid there's some   problem with the electronic lock system and I can't seem to get the doors to   release," I tell him. "So it seems I'm locked in and you're locked out." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I see," the Boss murmurs   slowly, possibly getting a nasal indication of a rodent in close proximity.   "I'll just try the emergency release." </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A couple of loud bangs   later, the boss picks up the phone, wheezing heavily. "The BLOODY GLASS won't   break!" he gasps. "What sort of emergency access is this?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I don't know, but it sounds   good for security," I mention, knowing that this is bound to get his back up.   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I'm going to call in Building   Maintenance to get to the bottom of this - you just hang on in there!" he cries   decisively, obviously wanting to make a good impression on all the newbies with   his ability to fix difficult situations. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Which means I'm going to   have to go back to work after all, as there's only so long that the armoured   glass and reverse-threaded access panel screws are going to keep the maintenance   guys at bay. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I grab a cab and slip into   the building the back way, sneak out the freight elevator and end up behind   the Boss and a set of like-minded technical in-breds whose combined IQ wouldn't   even make a supermodel's waist measurement. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Hi!" I blurt, thinking   of the PR value of being nice to potential users. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Where'd you come from?"   the Boss asks, gesturing to the buildings bloke that he should keep on drilling   now that he's about half an inch into the armoured glass (only another inch   to go). </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The computer room!" I   cry. "I managed to get the back door open by swiping my card through it repeatedly   - probably some read error, or something." </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I make a big deal of blowing   into the swipe reader, then try my card in the door. It opens, of course, and   I surreptitiously reverse the lockout on the doors, then let the crowd into   the computer room. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"This is the err..." the   Boss starts, noticing that I've come along for the tour, too, and am looking   extremely interested in what he's going to say. "Err...tell you what, why don't   we let someone from the front line fill you in!" </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Suffice to say my presentation   was a resounding success - especially after the Boss demonstrated workplace   danger by stepping onto one of the floor tiles we leave loosely supported (to   stop maintenance contractors from straying) and plunging face first into a machine   rack. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> On the way out, one of   the huggy-feelies from Human Resources meets me and gives me the boss's invite   to the 'welcome to the company' drinks that afternoon, seeing how the Boss is   probably not going to be able to attend... </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> And just when you think   life can't get any better, the PFY rings to say he knows what happened and that   he'll RELUCTANTLY keep his word - a bet's a bet - later that night. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Mental note number two   is to swap drinks with him the moment his attention is diverted at the pub -   the thought of a laxative overdose doesn't appeal at all. </font><p> <HR><Center>  <HR>  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>BOFH '99.</B> Private   Health...</font>  <HR></Center><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Out of the kindness of   their cold hearts, company management have allowed us contractors to join waged   and salaried staff in being eligible (at a reasonably hefty premium, of course)   to join the company Health Care Plan. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Sod that. I should get   a DISCOUNT for all the work I've put their way. If it wasn't for me, the company   wouldn't HAVE a health plan - or at least not one with such a comprehensive   Personal Accident Insurance section anyway... </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"But it's dirt cheap!"   the PFY claims, "and it's got personal accident cover which gives you unlimited   time in a private hospital." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Where no doubt they give   you chilli enemas until you manage to discharge yourself," I respond, all too   familiar with how good 'good deals' really are. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No, they've got pictures,"   he cries, completely taken in by the shiny brochures. "Just look!" </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I have to admit the pictures   do look impressive, with large stately hospital rooms, battalions of neatly   uniformed staff and sumptuous TV-dinner banquets, but I've seen far too many   computer brochures to be taken in by advertising. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It's just advertising   bumph," I remind the PFY. "None of it's true." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It might be," he murmurs.   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It's one of the commandments   of computing!" I cry. Never trust the brochure until you've had the covers off!"   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"But how can we see what   it's like if we don't sign up?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Sign up?" the Boss cries,   roaring into the room. "You mean the Health Plan? I've been a member for years."   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"But what are the hospitals   like - have you been to one?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Can't say I have," the   Boss replies, bending down to pick up the 19-inch flat screen monitor I've indicated   is his. "But when I do, you'll be the fir..." </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Halfway through his lift,   I pop the paper bag that I'd been holding. In shock, the boss shoots to attention   a little quicker than he has for a while. "Agh!" he cries, dropping the monitor   and clutching his stomach tightly. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Oops. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Of course, the PFY and   I take some time off work to see the Boss as he recovers from his hernia op.   And do a bit of shopping. OK, and have a few lagers as well. And a ride on the   London tour bus - but after that, we went straight there. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> At the hospital, we find   that my suspicions are unfounded - the place is a state of the art set-up, with   remote monitoring that would put our network topology to shame. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> We brown-nose an administrative   type to get a quick tour of the place, exhibiting a professional interest in   their CCPMS (Centralised Comprehensive Patient Monitoring System). </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Basically," the admin-type   burbles as we depart the Boss's room, "the system allows all patients to be   monitored by a central computer which, in the event of any problem, dispatches   a doctor or nurse from a localised aid station." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I see," I respond. "And   what happens if the doctor and nurse are elsewhere playing doctors and nurses?"   </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> After a withering look,   the admin-type continues. "The software is aware of staff positions at all times.   I assure you that your manager is completely safe from mishaps." </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Bugger. We were hoping   for a hernia relapse (or five) to get us a couple more office-hours visits to   the, er, hospital. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We have thousands of cables   from all over the hospital which terminate in the comms room," a furry-toothed   geek from the monitoring room informs us. "The wires deliver all the patient   data we need into the master computer and all patient details are available   on our touch-screen here." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Really?" I say, touching   the box showing the Boss's name. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"As you can see," the geek   continues, "these two windows are camera views of your manager's room, 22b.   This box charts his temperature, pulse and respiration, this one his brain wave   pattern - all are fed along the 22b cable sets to here, which saves us the tremendous   outlay of having to buy individual monitoring units for each... Oh dear!" </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The Boss's window has suddenly   turned crimson with the words 'CARDIAC CALLOUT'. As the geek and I look on,   a team arrives, strips the Boss down and gives him a couple of doses from the   kickstart machine. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well," the geek adds,   mopping his brow "as you can see, the efficiency of our team is second to none."   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yeah," the PFY says, replacing   a screwdriver, "but some of that termination in there is crap. Don't worry,   I gave the Boss's cableset a seeing-to and reterminated it..." </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The silence, as they say,   was deafening. The geek now knows that the Boss got his batteries charged for   no good reason, and that given an inquiry, the hospital - and his pet project   - wouldn't fare well. He looks at us desperately. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"A tenner a piece should   be sufficient for a couple of beers," I say. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Per day," the PFY adds.   </font><p> <HR><Center>  <HR>  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>BOFH '99.</B> The Company   Newsletter</font>  <HR></Center><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The boss's latest plan   is that we're going to put out a news-letter (not electronic - that would be   far too progressive and a paper version is much more useful as it can hang around   for years, way after the information has passed its 'use by' date) to boost   the department's standing... </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The theory is that, by   publishing a couple of pages of "The latest technology is...", "We've just bought..."   and "What you should know about..." on a bi-monthly basis, the workers at the   rock face aren't going to notice that we give all the really good kit to management,   and palm off the slow and mutilated crap to them. A cover-up in other words...   </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A brown-nose type from   PR is called in to help us create a marketable image, covering all bases from   soft-focus photography (the boss does look like his face caught fire and someone   tried to put it out with a potato masher) to non-threatening pseudo-computer   vocab and pastel-tint papers. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> He also excels in choosing   topics as far off the issue of service level as possible: how many miles of   Cat-5 (high-speed connection cable) there are in the building, how many support   staff have been on training courses, the value of our central computing resource,   technology we're investigating...And, of course, the boss wants a quick article   from me on new kit we're looking at, when we expect it to be installed, and   useful user info...in other words, write the whole bloody thing. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Now, I like giving out   info to the users almost as much as MPs like talking to their constituents so,   obviously, I'm really looking forward to this idea. Not. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> What makes it worse is   that my directive is to make it so simple that anyone in the building can understand   it. I'm just hoping he's not including the security staff in that statement   as I don't think our laser printers produce output in crayon. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Nevertheless, with the   input of the PFY, we manage to get enough information to fill the required two   pages and whip it off to the printers as a rush job, asap - after clearing it   with the boss, of course. So I have to admit to being a bit dismayed, even gobsmacked,   when the boss bursts into the office the next day in a mood that can only be   described as 'fit to burst'. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What the hell's this?"   he asks, waving something ferociously. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The newsletter," I cry,   not to be confused by the obvious. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I know that, but it's   nothing like the one you gave me to proof-read yesterday!" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No, I had to translate   it from the technical jargon you read into something the users would understand."   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"But it's a bloody nightmare!"   he shouts. "They're confused." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, I have to admit   it's possible that the simplification of the text may have caused one or two   technical inaccuracies, but the gist of the information is there." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"TECHNICAL INACCURACIES?!   You told them the toner cartridges are refilled with ink and that it's relatively   simple." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, I didn't think they'd   grasp the idea of toner. And it is a simple job of drilling a hole in the cartridge   and replacing the toner - if the drum and fuser are OK, of course." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes, well, thanks to that   article we've got a printer in the workshop that's only suitable for parts."   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, it's hardly a major   problem is it?," the PFY chips in. "After all, they've got a projected lifetime   of three years." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"That's not the point.   Anyway, it wasn't just that article that was a problem - why did you tell people   that they should wash their machines out if the network was going slow?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What?! Oh, you mean the   analogy of a network connection being a pipe and that a bigger pipe lets more   go through it?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes, but you said they   should wash their machines out!" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No , I simply said that,   as an owner, you want as much water into your machine as possible, but I was   talking about traffic." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"So, why tell them to connect   a firehose to their machine?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"An analogy - big hose,   lots of data.

Why did you tell them to install 'Infector' on their machines?"   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Infector? No, I told them   to install 'Detector'.

I cry over to the PFY as he brings up yet another box of comms gear. My attention was distracted because I foolishly picked up the phone and talked to a user. It was a straightforward wonky phone problem - nothing too difficult to deal with - particularly when the user has his hands on Network Tool #2, the wire cutter. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes, that's right, put   the clippers onto the wire, yes, and snap close." CLICK. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Did you sort that user's   phone out?" the PFY asks. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I have now. Any more boxes?"   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No, that's the last one.   What is all this junk?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh it's just a load of   boxes with lights and beepers in them," I reply. "I'm going to put them in the   boss's office." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"This wouldn't happen to   be because he wants to increase his hands on?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Of course, if he wants   to help monitor the network, who am I to stop him." </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The boss beams with pride   as the PFY and I install the last of the boxes, his rooms is now about to become   ablaze with more than 3,000 flashing lights, all with corresponding beeps of   various tones. "So this monitoring equipment is usually in the Comms cupboards   then?" the boss asks. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Sure," the PFY replies,   screwing in the last LED, which is actually a fibre optic camera so we can see   the effects of our experiment. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Usually we check them   for failures every couple of days, but with you on the case, we should be able   to really cut down on network problems. It'll look great on the weekly reports."   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It looks very impressive,   how do I know when they fail?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh one of the lights will   go out. I'll check in later to make sure it's all running properly," I say as   the PFY flicks the ON switch and the room explodes with the cacophony of beeps   and the dazzle of lights. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> As we leave the office   I glance at the PFY. "So, ten quid says he won't last the day." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You're on!" he replies,   sensing quick money. He never learns. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Later in the day the boss's   stress levels have obviously increased. He is storming around a lot more than   usual and he's barking at everybody, except the PFY, and me. He doesn't want   to admit he can't handle the monitoring equipment. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"So how are you getting   on?" I ask as I cancel the entire fourth floor's network access, just when the   boss is monitoring the equipment to catch it. A quick TCP message to the PFY   primes him for a response. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh fine." he replies.   "So far I haven't noticed any problems." </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Cue PFY. "Uh-oh, the fourth   floor's down!" he shouts, furiously hammering irrelevant buttons on his keyboard.   </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The boss panics as I sigh   discreetly. "We need to know what went down, can you go and see what lights   went out?" I hand him a network resource chart. "This is a map of all 3,000   lights. Just tick off those which look like they're out," I add helpfully. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The boss is looking very   worried now. If he packs in the hands-on scheme the CEO will surely notice and   reprimand him for wasting time, so he trots off back to his office as I flick   off the power remotely to four of the 3,000 lights and put most of the others   on dim. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A few hours later still   the PFY and I are standing outside his office as a user has been complaining   that his power light is blinking. The result of boss's constant exposure to   the monitoring equipment is satisfying to say the least. "WE'VE ALL GOT OUR   LIGHTS TO DEAL WITH," he roars. "DOWN HERE I HAVE THOUSANDS OF BLINKING, FLASHING   AND BEEPING LIGHTS, THEY BLINK AND FLASH AND BEEP. I CAN'T STAND IT ANYMORE,   THE BEEPING AND FLASHING AND BLINKING!" </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> As the ex-boss is stretchered   away, writhing uncomfortably in his straitjacket, the PFY looks penitent. "Perhaps   we were a little too hard on him. He was only trying to help." </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It's a shame. After all   this time, the PFY just doesn't understand that nobody should help a Bastard   out in networking. Time for the cattle prod - and a strong laxative coffee later   on. </font><p> <HR><Center>  <HR>  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>BOFH '99.</B> More Huggy   Feely...</font>  <HR></Center><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> As a result of the PFY's   evil machinations he and I are in one of those disgusting huggy-feely sessions   where everyone tells everyone else how they feel about their place in the world.   Or, in this case, the company. As if it isn't bad enough having to rub shoulders   with users, we're supposed to share our thoughts with them. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> And of course the tweed-suit   who's chairing the session has loaded it with people who the boss feels are   victims of the Systems and Networks 'aggressive policy of solving problems'.   The theory is that the PFY and I will see the error of our ways when we come   face to face with our former 'clients'. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Now, who would like to   start?" Tweedy smiles, looking around the group expectantly... </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Ten minutes later, we're   back in the office because no one had anything to say. Maybe the PFY's dictaphone   put them off - but he only had it because he wanted to reflect upon the users'   feelings afterwards... </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The boss, noticing our   rapid return, forgoes the 'I hope you've learned your lesson' speech. And distressingly,   there is still no promise of an Easter bonus. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Being the dedicated type,   I decide to put the disappointment out of my mind and do some preventive maintenance   on the beancounters' asset audit server machine. After all, they were the ones   complaining about our level of service the loudest before the PFY and I walked   into the room. (The old sub-miniature microphone in the RJ45 'terminator' trick   never fails). Apparently the machine is running slowly. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Our telling them yesterday   that they're using twice as many sessions as they'd specced the machine for   wasn't seen as constructive criticism. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Careful with the hammer,"   the PFY cries, ducking under the backswing of one of my more enthusiastic applications   of maintenance. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Woopsy," I say guiltily,   "got a bit carried away there." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No harm done - to me anyway,"   he murmurs as he lifts up a floor tile and kicks the results of the 'maintenance'   into the subfloor area. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Takes a licking but keeps   on ticking," I say, tapping the battle-scarred machine cage. And, inadvertently,   pressing the power-off switch. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Bugger. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In my mind's eye I can   already see the chief beancounter hitting the panic button to counter the potential   threat to asset security. Not being a believer in coincidence, he's bound to   think the outage is a deliberate (which - at least in this case - it isn't)   effort to perform some non-audit trailed modifications to the fixed asset inventory.   </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Sigh. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Like we didn't do that   a fortnight ago. During the day. Logged on as him so if the audit trail is ever   investigated... However, this isn't going to help much when he sets eyes on   the server that looks as though it's done several tours of duty in Beirut. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Sure enough, he's not at   all happy when the boss drags him into the computer room to assuage his fears.   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What the hell happened   to that?" he gasps, seeing the battle-scarred casing. "It's all bashed about!"   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, nothing lasts forever   - wear and tear..." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It's only two months old."   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Two months is a long time   in computing," I chip in. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Besides, it was pretty   battered when the courier dropped it off," the PFY adds. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Why did you sign for it   then?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, it seemed to fire   up OK," I said </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Good grief, it looks like   it's been beaten with a hammer. Are you sure the couriers did all that?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, the couriers did   some of it, but the cleaning staff probably helped." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We don't allow cleaners   in this room," the boss interjects. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes I know," I say sadly,   "That's why I have to do it." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"So you damaged our machine?"   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I'm afraid so," I sigh.   "I'm a system administrator, not really a cleaner." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"And I'm a lover, not a   fighter," the PFY adds, obviously having tipped a little too much tape-head   cleaner on his Weeties this morning. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The humour break is interrupted   by the server plummeting to the floor, as the screws holding the shelf in place   - loosened during maintenance - lose purchase on the rack. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The aftermath of this little   accident doesn't bear thinking about, but, suffice to say, we're in huggy-feely   central the next morning, and Tweedy and cohorts are in attendance. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Now, who would like to   start?" Tweedy asks benevolently. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Ah, I would," I say. "I'd   like to share my feelings." </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Sigh... </font><p> <HR><Center>  <HR>  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>BOFH '99.</B> Barroom   Blitz...</font>  <HR></Center><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I stumble into work early   (well, in time for morning tea) to find one of our boundary routers has crashed   overnight, requiring the PFY to be called out to restart it. And, with the boss   getting extremely tight on overtime, the PFY has been forced to take time in   lieu for the late-night call-out, instead of being paid for it. At least, that's   the official version. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The Bastard-interpreted   version is that the PFY was out on night alcohol manoeuvres (network people   must network), forgot about the Tube times and had to get a cab home - only   he'd spent all his pennies in the relentless pursuit of boozing. He would have   jumped on the chance to get a work-paid ride back to his humble abode, with   time off to heal his battle scars. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Plan 17B from the Big-Bastard   Book of Bludges: toggle the power to an important unit, wait an hour, turn the   kit back on, then grab a free cab home, with in-lieu recovery time to boot...   </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Checking the top drawer   of the PFY's desk, in case he'd been forced to 'upload some data' during 'call-out',   all seems well, so I settle down to read the paper. A few hours later, the PFY   stumbles in, looking like his face has been used as a doorknocker. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I eventually get the PFY's   story - he was at the local pub doing some late-night 'birdspotting' and followed   a 'migration' to an after-hours cocktail drinker. Upset by the Tom Cruise wannabe   behind the bar, he'd apparently flicked a lit match onto the spillage of spirits   on the bar...not what the big bouncers would call acceptable behaviour. You   get that on the big jobs. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> So, as expected, he's not   feeling great, and wouldn't do our name any good if I sent him out with the   Client Unserviceable Equipment list..."Ah, here's that Client Unserviceable   Equipment I was talking about yesterday - if you could just visit them and check   out what's wrong with their kit?" </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> What the hell. I'm sure   he'll appreciate the chance to counsel a user on the correct approach to the   contrast versus brightness dilemma on their monitor...I open a window to the   CCTV in the fourth-floor cubicle farm, and crank up the inbuilt microphone to   listen to the PFY's first mission... </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"So your meetings always   get scheduled an hour after everyone else's?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes. Do you think it's   my clock setting?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Possibly," the PFY murmurs   slowly. "But we should really seek out the root of the problem." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Maybe it's daylight saving?"   the user suggests, helpfully. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No, that's just a complication.   The real cause is most likely to be the inability to find the disk-based Time-Zone   configs." </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Ah, Find and Disk in the   same sentence - he's going for the old F(ind)DISK approach. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"So it wouldn't be the   RAM battery on the motherboard?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"?" utters the PFY, recognising   a tinkerer and discarding the FDISK plan. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You know, that keeps the   clock ticking." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, if it were that,   your clock setting would reset every time you booted your machine," the PFY   points out. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Mind you, it could be   a battery capacitance problem!" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Battery capacitance?!"   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes, you know about Nicad   Memory, also called internal resistance?" the PFY says, appealing to the geekal   lobe of the user's brain. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Uh, yes." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, batteries also have   a capacitance, storing a reverse charge, which, when a machine is off, reduces   the battery voltage, causing a reduced junction voltage in the oscillator controlling   time generation." </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> DUMMY MODE ON! </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Duh-huh." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"So, what do we do?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, it so happens that   I have a booster capacitor kit in the office, which can remove any stray capacitance   in the battery..." </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Five minutes later..."Isn't   that a strobe light with a lead coming from where the lamp should be?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Ha ha ha," chuckles the   PFY. "No, I admit it looks like that, but that's just a...Capacitance Shield."   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Now, we just connect these   leads up like so, plug her in, turn your machine on...stand back...and switch   her..." </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> One small explosion later..."Lucky   we found that dodgy nicad!" the PFY gasps. "That could have caused problems."   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"But my machine's ruined!"   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No, it's not - look, that   processor would make a lovely pendant!

Oh!" he adds, catching sight   of a case on the desk. "Does your laptop have the same problem? </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"NO!" shouts the hapless   user, clutching the machine to his chest. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well I'll be off then."   Another dissatisfied customer... </font><p> <HR><Center>  <HR>  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>BOFH '99.</B> The cleaner   connection....</font>  <HR></Center><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> So, I'm taking calls because   the PFY's on holiday and I have no one to play Quake deathmatches against. It's   the usual run-of-the-mill thing with several "power users" from PR ringing to   find out why they can't print to the shared laser printer. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Being in a reasonably calm   state of mind, I don't expose the callers to the verbal barrage of my thoughts   on their inability to read the notices pinned on the noticeboards, stuck to   the printer in question and sent via email to them over the past month or so   before the printer's retirement from service. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> And still they call. Even   though the printer has been gone for a week. Even though there's now a person   occupying the cubicle where it was.. even though that person tells them that   the two-page-per-minute power-sucking monster has gone. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I keep a tight rein on   my temper, knowing full well that it really shouldn't bug me that much. My resolve   is sorely tested however, when I get a call from the bastard (L)User from Hell.   The word incompetent doesn't even begin to describe his technical inability   -- he couldn't find his arse with a road map, a compass, mirror and torch. In   fact, if his brain activity dipped any lower it would be legal to harvest his   organs. And the boss has taken him under his wing in one of his goodwill-generating   missions. So far this week he's rung three times because his machine's been   hacked (the caps lock key was on when he typed in his password). He also rang   to report that his computer had been infected with the "not a system disk, hit   F1" virus, and to tell us that our time server was three seconds out from the   speaking clock. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Still, the boss is keenly   aware of any shortcomings in our service. The phone rings. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"My machine's locked me   out again!" he blurts. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Is your caps lock key   on again?" I ask. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Of course not!" he snaps.   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"And what does it say when   you get your password wrong?" "I don't get my password wrong! I always write   it down on the bottom of my keyboard to be sure!" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Of course you do," I respond,   humbled by the lengths users will go to to protect their work. "And what did   the computer tell you when you got your password...er...right?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It didn't say anything!"   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I see. And did you check   your password this morning?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, yes! I can't be   expected to remember everything!" "And you pulled your keyboard out of the socket   in the back of your machine?" </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Some fumbling noises follow,   after which..."no, I didn't." The bollock-o-meter is registering "Liar, liar!   Pants on fire!", so I can guess what's going to come next. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh, it's come right now   -- must have been a glitch or something..." </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Sigh. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"...But I've noticed that   the keyboard plug is a little loose." </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Right! That's it! "Yes   it's..." I quickly turn to my Excuse of the Day calendar. "...Oh! It's an carbon   dioxidation problem." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The oxidation from carbon   dioxide in the air makes the plastic shrink. That's why your monitor probably   makes creaking noises." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You can fix it, of course.   Do you have a pot plant in your office?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes, I have a couple."   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, chuck one behind   your machine and one on the top of the monitor -- they'll extract the carbon   dioxide from the air.." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Of course! Well, thank   you for that at least." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No problem. Now be sure   to give them a really good watering so they can generate that oxygen. Lots of   water." </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Five minutes later the   boss is in with the bad news about Mr Incompetent. He survived. And he only   lost a monitor and popped a circuit breaker. He couldn't even electrocute himself   properly. So now I have to rush a replacement monitor to him. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I get back to my office   after installing it to hear the phone ringing. He's upset because the screen   colours are up the spout. I almost tell him about the two disk drive magnets   I taped to the base of the unit, just to get him to leave me alone, but that's   just giving in. And I'm no quitter. It's time to send in a cleaner. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Later on, the boss fills   me in on the gory details. "...And, apparently, he tripped and dropped a large   bucket of water on top of his machine," the boss burbles. "Which is a hell of   a coincidence when you think about it" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"So he'll need another   monitor?" I ask. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Actually no. The cleaning   guy was helping to mop up the mess and accidentally slammed Dave's hand in the   drawer -- three times!" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh. Well, all's well that   ends well. Anyway, can't stop, I'm going for a drink with Mike." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The cleaning guy?" </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Some questions are best   left unanswered.. </font><p> <HR><Center>  <HR>  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>BOFH '99.</B> Banana Dictator?!?</font>  <HR></Center><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It's a Tuesday morning   and a new boss has started (the old having taken 'early retirement'). The office   periscopes are up to see what the new one is going to be like. I bide my time,   knowing that he's bound to show his face sooner or later. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> There are a few potential   types that seem likely - the 'hide-in-the-office-and-annoy-nobody' type, the   'tell-me-what-you-REALLY, HONESTLY think' huggy-feely type and, worst of all,   the Banana Democracy Dictator type. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Hide-in-the-office appears   to be on the cards as he hasn't shown his face to the troops yet... </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A large box arrives in   the office with my name on it. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I'm not expecting anything   - except perhaps the small cheque from the management placement agency that   I get whenever they supply us a new boss (about three times a year). </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A quick recce of the box   and its packing slip shows that it's about a company's-worth of client software   for a database we don't have. Seconds later the courier arrives with another   box, which I divine to be the missing server portion. Uh-oh. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Having not ordered it,   I efficiently return it to sender. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Its origin becomes apparent   when the new boss bowls up with instructions on how, where and when to install   it. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh, I sent that back because   I hadn't ordered it," I cry. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Ah yes. Well, I ordered   it yesterday," he chips in quickly, "and I'll be ordering all hardware and software   from now on." </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> BANANA DICTATOR ALERT!   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I see. And what was the   software to be used for again?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I'm going to get our financial   systems moved to alternative software that's far easier to learn and administer."   (He's got a mate who works at a small financial systems company that he's letting   get a foot in our company). I don't like it. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I don't see how that would   be an advantage given that all our current staff know the software we're using."   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Ah, but this is ISO98000   certified," he enthuses. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"98000?" the PFY cries.   "But we're were only up to 9000." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well 98000 was a combination   of ISO9000 certification and the lesser-known 8000 - which dealt with secure   financial transactions," he burbles. "Now make sure this stuff gets uploaded   for installation double time." </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I smell a grey furry animal   with a liking for food scraps. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Just to be sure, I run   a quick scan of ISO titles. After having been woken for the third time (ISO   stuff is notorious for its insomnia-curing ability), my suspicions are proved   correct. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Then I start wondering...that   voice is strangely familiar. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I examine the software   in more detail. Inside the flashy CD covers are swags of hand-labelled write-once   media. Curiouser and curiouser. And, the Web link to the site is a dead-end   page with "Site being revamped" on it. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Hmmm... I decide to confront   the boss. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes, yes, they're a global   company with blue-chip clients so they don't have enough time to install SSL-secured   Web pages with Java-enhanced search algorithms," he responds. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Good answer. The sort of   response you'd expect from a b... </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"My machine's having problems,"   I mention to him in passing. "I think the floppy drive needs cleaning." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Really?" he says. "It's   probably...um...transient hysterisis loops in the head media." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You're sure?" I ask, my   suspicions confirmed. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Positive. And you'll need   to clear the hysterisis with a resonant magnetic distortion rectifier. Do you   have one?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, I suppose you could   use a hammer and a screwdriver at a pinch," he mutters. "You just slip the screwdriver   into the drive until you feel a slight resistance..." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"...And bash the living   crap out of it until you're down to the handle?" I ask. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"W-Yes, how do you know?"   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You're a bastard," I reply.   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No I'm not!" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes you are. And you're   unregistered..." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No I'm not - I'm a MMBMFH,"   he says smugly. A Member of the Masonic Bastard Managers From Hell, no less!   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I see. How does it work   then?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, you form a handful   of 'manufacturing' companies, produce dodgy code, then get a job as a manager   somewhere (using the references obtained from your companies), then buy up your   code as the solution to everything at an artificially inflated price, then accept   a rapid redundancy (with benefits) when the whole business slides down the toilet."   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Which only leaves me two   questions," I say. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What's in it for you,   and when will the bomb drop? Let's see, A couple of grand 'external consultancy   fees', and next Wednesday?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Next Wednesday?!" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yeah, I'm sure there's   a virulent virus on the install media." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I'll get right on to it!"   I cry. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Always good to work with   a pro. </font><p> <HR><Center>  <HR>  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>BOFH '99.</B> Creative   Cooling...</font>  <HR></Center><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> So the boss has found out   that I was using the four-way processor machine to keep my lunch warm, and isn't   happy. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I would've got away with   it, too, if I hadn't asked for extra brown sauce and it hadn't leaked from the   brown paper bag onto the motherboard of the machine. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> R&D aren't happy because   they were using the machine for stress-loading some Web page software to see   how the machines would handle stacks of connections. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I wasn't all that happy   myself - not when I found out that the problem was actually caused by the processor's   heat output burning a hole in the bag concerned. A definite mark-down of the   hardware performance... </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> So now the boss is on the   warpath, attempting to make sure that no other piece of kit is being used 'inappropriately'.   </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> And wouldn't you know it,   he manages to stumble - in his inept way - across the hose that connects the   cooling inlet of the chunky old mainframes to the computer room's centralised   vacuum-cleaning system. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?!"   he screams. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Ah, it's a centralised   vacuum-cleaning system." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What's it connected to   this machine for?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, you know how temperamental   processors are with dust and stuff? I just run the vacuum system through it   to make sure none collects inside the machine." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"But that's the machine's   INLET!" he squeaks. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I decide to come clean.   "Remember when I told you the centralised vacuum-cleaning system was packing   up?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes. And?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, it did. And, by   a one-in-a-million chance, the bag burst when I was there, which is when I noticed   that the mainframe was an excellent source of suction." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You're using the mainframe   as a vacuum cleaner?!?" he screams again, worst fears realised. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well...yeah." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Are you insane?! What   about the fire risk?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No worries. We always   empty the machine when dust starts coming out of the floppy drive. Besides,   the boards are so sparse the processors rarely even get warm!" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I don't believe this!"   he murmurs sadly, shaking his head. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"So I suppose we shouldn't   tell you about the air conditioning ducts then," the PFY mentions gently. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The air conditioning ducts?"   the boss cringes, not really wanting to know the full horror that might await   his question, but unable to stop himself. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, we're keeping a   bit of kit in them - but only the stuff that runs really hot," the PFY concedes.   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I...," the boss mumbles,   having a short out-of-mind experience."Why?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well it runs too hot for   the computer room, so if we put it in the cooling ducts, it runs OK." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"And what happens in winter,   when the air is hotter?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh, we thought we'd cross   that bridge when we drive under it - as Teddy Kennedy would say." </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Images of fires spreading   through the building take their toll on the boss and he wanders off mumbling.   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Machines in the ducting?   A little far-fetched isn't it?" I ask. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yeah, well, I was pushed   for time.

"It might look like the company was trying to hide something from the Inland   Revenue." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Haven't they got an anonymous   tip-off line?" I ask. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You don't scare me!" the   boss cries. "I can't be held liable for anything that my predecessors should   have known." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Of course you can't!"   I agree. "No, it'll be us for the high jump - followed a few days later by the   collapse of the company's core computing because of ignorance on the part of   the remaining IT staff. I'd hate to be the manager of that little mess." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, it's the head of   IT's fault for not paying more attention, then!" the boss cries. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes," the PFY comments   dryly. "I'm sure he's going to take the fall and not just palm the blame onto   a subordinate." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I'll just get my resignation   done then," the boss sighs as he stumbles off, a broken man. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh, and can you turn over   the chicken and mushroom pie on the applications server for me?" the PFY calls.   "I don't like them too crispy..." </font><p> <HR><CENTER>  <H2><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The dastardly duo employ     some very underhand tactics to weed out 'unsuitable' applicants for the boss's     job.

I cry, shoving   the CV into the bin-based encryption device. "I'm sure there's SOMEONE with   the right skills." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"OK," the PFY cries, holding   up a photo. "Next is THIS gent." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I SAY!" I blurt, unable   to restrain myself. "LOOK AT THOSE SLACKS! What colour is that, do you think?   Dusky pink or rampant purple?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Looks rampant to me,"   the PFY says. "A left-handed golfer...?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You mean gay?" the HR-droid   says. "What the hell does it matter if..." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, it doesn't matter   to us, but you know how homophobic our CEO is." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I can't believe..." he   responds, wondering which decade he's in - but then folding - "...I suppose   you're right." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"That was a bit dodgy,   wasn't it?" the PFY asks later. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Dodgy isn't the word.   For a start, I coloured-in his outfit." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You bastard!" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"And secondly, he's a mate   of the CEO.

"I would obviously have a great   deal to do with the analysis, installation and testing of new equipment. I know   how you technical people like to remain focused on the job at hand -- sorting   out user problems and that sort of thing - so I'd probably get my hands dirty   on the technical side, leaving you free to pursue your helpdesk calls and user   enquiries." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I see," I comment ambivalently.   "Well, that concludes my questions - perhaps you'd like to take a tour of our   facilities." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"That would be excellent!"   he cries happily, assuming that a guided tour means the job's as good as his.   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Fine," the HR droid responds.   "I'm sure Simon's assistant would be more than happy to take care of you." </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The PFY nods and leads   contestant number one away. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Contestant number two arrives   and he's much the same as the first, except probably not as technically competent   - if that's humanly possible. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I settle down to listen   to some more company history... </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I'M SORRY.

"I've been putting in some   late nights on the...uh...high availability...er...tape racking system." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Any questions for this   candidate?" HR droid asks. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Just the one," I murmur,   repeating the question I asked of number one. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well I'd have to have   a reasonable amount of input in the selection process - verifying that it's   value for money, what the company wants, that sort of thing. Outside of that   I suppose it's up to you to determine what the users need." </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Close, but no cigar. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Perhaps you'd like a tour   of the facilities," HR droid pre-empts. A nod to the PFY is as good as a wink   and he's gone in a second. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The third candidate is   cut from the same cloth as the first two. He leaves for his tour as the HR droid   turns to the remaining applicant's CV. "I have to admit that this one does look   impressive," he says, "but I think that if he's any good we probably need to   get him and the first applicant back for a second interview." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh, the first applicant   won't be coming back," the PFY says casually. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"And why's that?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, you asked me to,   you know - take care of them..." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes - show them around!"   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh! I'm afraid I may have   misinterpreted your intentions." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You haven't tested the   halon system with someone in the computer room again have you?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Uh..." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"My God!" the HR droid   cries. "I can't believe this!" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Neither can I!" I blurt.   "Do you know how much halon costs? And what about the ozone layer?" </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The HR droid looks like   he's set to explode...which is why it's important not to tell him that the PFY   just took the candidates out the back way and told them that we'd be in touch   shortly after hell froze over. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I can't believe you thought   I meant..." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"That's what I thought   you meant!" I cry. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"But we're a company, not   some underworld money laundering operation!" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"But what about when the   CEO..." the PFY gasps. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I shake my head quickly   (as planned) and the PFY shuts up. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Two days later, the appointment   has gone through and there's a code of silence between the three people on the   appointments team. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> He thinks we won't implicate   him, and in return he selects, without interview, the candidate that we wanted...   who doesn't really exist. </font><p> <HR><Center>  <HR>  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>BOFH '99.</B> The boss   that wasn't....</font>  <HR></Center><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It's a lovely day for computing, having -- as we do -- no boss, and the PFY and I are milking it for all it's worth. <p> Well, when I say no boss, I really mean no physical boss.

And Roger's just suggested I upgrade to business   class so that I'm rested and able to take in all the information presented to   me when I get there. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> But it was doomed to end.   And this time it's at the hands of the head of IT, with only a small amount   of notice for us to prepare for it. He didn't take too kindly to the boss's   idea of users getting support only when they beat the PFY or me in a Quake II   Deathmatch. Well, that and the deluge of purchases from the technical bookstore   which previous bosses wouldn't buy just because they cost an arm and a leg.   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"RIGHT!" the head of IT   cries as he bursts in with an IT budget's-worth of literature invoices, "THIS   IS THE END!" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes," I sigh, slipping   on a black armband. "It's terrible!" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Cut down in his prime!"   the PFY sniffs sympathetically. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Why do the good ones always   die young?"

But it's always   on!" she lies. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Try pressing the caps   lock key to turn it off, then try again." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It's not going to work...Oh,   the machine's fixed now" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Now that your CAPS LOCK   light is off?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes, but I gave the wire   a wiggle before I tried again. It's probably the wire..." </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> She rings off and the PFY   hangs up, shaking his head. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Double or quits she rings   back within 10 minutes?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"OK!" </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Ten minutes and another   10 later, the PFY is trying to help Maureen understand why the new cable could   not have deleted all the files she was working on this morning. Another 10 minutes   and 20 after that, the PFY is explaining to Maureen that a new cable can't   break her e-mail, and the reason she has no e-mail is because no one's sending   her any. The PFY promises to send her a test message. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Five minutes and 40 later   the PFY says he's not playing double or quits any more, and is explaining that   HE misspelled 'verification', and that it's not the cable introducing spelling   mistakes into the network traffic. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What the hell am I going   to do?" the PFY asks, after the new boss comes in (very harassed) to ask what   the hell the PFY has done to this woman's machine. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What is your sin?" I ask.   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"NOTHING! I just replaced   her cable! If I'd known, I would've avoided her like the plague!" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"She'd have've noticed   that everyone else's machines have fewer problems than hers -- now that they   have new cables..." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well how do we fix her   problem?" the PFY pleads. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We don't," I say, picking   up the phone, "We relocate it." </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I call the boss back in   and tell him that we've just found out that some of the cables were faulty.   Being green and keen, he offers to take her up a new one. The poor bastard.   Later, as the PFY and I are leaving, we hear the boss helping Maureen through   her caps lock login dilemma again... </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I s'pose I owe you a pint   then?" the PFY asks. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"MANY pints!" </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Experience -- a great teacher,   but the tutition fees... </font><p> <HR><Center>  <HR>  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>BOFH '99.</B> Who's tucking   who?</font>  <HR></Center><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> So I'm peering inside a   PC at the PFY's request - apparently he's seen something he doesn't like. And   if he doesn't like it, it must be in bad shape... </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I proceed to check off   everything in the diagnostic list. "Hard drive, check; P-II 300, check; 128   Meg Memory, check; 512K L2 Cache, che..." </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I pause. What would appear,   at first glance, to be an L2 cache module is, in fact, a plastic replica of   the real thing. I test this observation by removing it from the running machine.   I reboot, and get the same diagnostic report. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We've been ripped off!"   I gasp to the PFY, after noticing the company's inventory sticker on the side   of the machine. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Who'd you get these from?"   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I...," the PFY responds,   "...didn't get them from anywhere." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, I didn't order them,   we're the only people cleared to purchase computing equip...THE BEANCOUNTERS!"   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You guessed it," the PFY   commented. "They ordered the kit themselves because the stuff we buy is 'too   expensive' -- they can get these 200 cheaper." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"And a few components shorter..."   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Then they whack an inventory   sticker on it and put it in use. Only, these ones don't appear to be working   so well..." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Hangs, crashes, that sort   of thing?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Uh-huh." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It's clock chipped, isn't   it?" I ask, knowing the answer. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yep - and they try to   get away with it by running a six-volt cooling fan at about nine volts through   a couple of resistors." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Off the 12-volt line?"   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The 11.7-volt line on   this model, yes." </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Sigh. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"And, don't tell me, they   want us to fix it now?" </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The PFY gestures to a pile   of machines in the corner. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Stuff em!" I yell, making   an executive decision that's bound to annoy some executives. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What's all this?" the   boss asks, right on time, having been wound up by one of the senior bean counters,   who's come for immoral support. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It's a non-approved computing   purchase." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Approved, non-approved;   what's the difference? It needs a service!" he blurts. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Approved equipment is   equipment that we've checked, kit that's passed field and benchmark tests."   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"My laptop hasn't passed   your tests, and it's running OK!" the head beancounter chips in. "Although the   backlight's a bit dim." </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I skip the obvious response   - fish in a barrel and all that... </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It may well be OK but,   unless it's passed our tests, we're not required to service it," I murmur, as   the PFY pulls out the IT Departmental Policy Document, indicating the pertinent   portion of text. The boss is powerless to counter that one. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Fifteen minutes later,   the beancounter's dropped his machine off for testing. Fifteen minutes after   that, we've dropped it from ceiling height onto a table. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Did it leave a mark?"   I ask. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"A small one," the PFY   notes, looking at the testbench top. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"But you'd better test   it again, to be sure..." </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Sadly, the owner enters   the room shortly thereafter, in time to witness us throwing darts at his machine.   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU   DOING?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Floating point tests,"   I murmur. "All that's left now is the Spec Int." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Spec Int?" he asks, gazing   at the dented remains of his machine. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes, it's a benchmark   rating." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I KNOW WHAT IT IS!" he   shouts. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, we're just about   to test it now." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"And HOW are you going   to do that?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I'm going to see if INTegrates   with another SPECies - namely, the dog from next door's building site." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"This is bloody ridiculous!   Give me my machine!" he snaps. Which, incidentally, is exactly what the hinge   at the back of the unit does as it plummets to the ground. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"IS there a floormark test?"   the PFY asks. "That's a new one on me." </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Surprisingly enough, the   beancounter storms off without responding, destined, it appears, for the head   of IT's office. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"OK: large pile of excrement   in close proximity to wind movement device. We've got machines to test! Quickly   now, pass them up to me, and make sure you note the benchmark each one leaves,   and let's be thorough!" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Quite right" the PFY concurs.   "Wouldn't do to be unprofessional, would it?" </font><p> <HR><Center>  <HR>  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>BOFH '99.</B> Bored Once   More...</font>  <HR></Center><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Bored, bored, bored. I'm   bored. The PFY's on holiday, and there's no-one in the building who's any match   for him at Quake II. There's only one thing for it. I'm just going to have to   make my own fun. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"They're bloody magic!"   the head of security remarks joyfully, in response to my enquiry about our new   proximity activated access cards. "The users don't have to ferret around in   their wallets for their swipe cards, and we don't have problems with dirty swipe   readers -- they're brilliant! And we can track people throughout the building.   It's great!" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"And it's helpful to us   too," the head of personnel blurts excitedly, "interfacing it to the phone system   so that your phone automatically diverts to whichever room you're in at the   moment is a godsend!" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"So I take it we're all   happy and I should go ahead and pay the invoices from the telecomms and security   people?" </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The boss considers it for   a slight moment, weighing up the trolleyload of brownie points he stands to   gain from this decision before casting the deciding vote... </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The tracking WILL be used   only by security, won't it?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"OF COURSE!" I cry -- knowing   that the vendor's product is no match for the tracking software we've been using   for the last two years. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"There'll be only two viewing   stations -- the Head of Security's office and the Ground Floor Security desk."   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"In that case, where do   I sign?" he asks, smiling. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Smiles break out all round   as the boss slaps his OK on the bottom of the fairly modest invoices. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What does 'TEST SITE'   mean exactly?" he asks, slightly concerned at some fine print on the contract.   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It means we get the software   at a discounted rate because we agree to notify them of any problems in the   product." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"PROBLEMS with the product?"   the boss asks warily. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes, you know like we   have with ALL the kit -- only this time the vendor WANTS us to tell them about   it, and they'll fix them!" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"And they're giving us   a DISCOUNT for this?!" he cries, not believing our good fortune. I reassure   him, he seems satisfied. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Not wanting to waste any   time, I grab the approved invoices and take them up to accounts. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The sad thing about systems   like this is that they normally never reach their full potential until someone   like me, with time on his hands, thinks outside the square, for the good of   all. Well, for a bit of a laugh, anyway. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I wait a couple of tedium-filled   days until security has collected the old access cards and decommissioned the   swipe readers before putting my plan into action. First, modify the phone system's   'Follow Me' function to call the LAST room you were in, instead of the current   one... </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Next, vary the proximity   on doors so that you have to be right on top of one before it releases. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The stage is set, the characters   ready... </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I choose the CCTV monitoring   the door with the least proximity sense, which happens to be beside the coffee   machine, slap a video into the recorder and wait for the boss. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Half an hour of impatience   is rewarded when the boss wanders through the door, and makes himself a very   hot black coffee. I crank the sensors depth to 0mm and the boss ploughs into   the door with his steaming styrofoam. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Beautiful! </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I unlock the door to let   him out, then phone him as he leaves the room -- he knows it's for him because   he's reported the late 'follow me' to me twice already...and ploughs into the   door again. I think I might be onto a 'Funniest Video' winner here. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A loud thud announces the   boss's arrival at Mission Control along with a faint trickle of red on the glass   at around nose height. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I hate myself, I really   do. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It's not pretty. The boss   is ranting at me, which upsets my concentration so much I overwrite the video   I've just made. Bugger! </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"AND ANOTHER THING! WHY   THE HELL DOES MY PAGER GO OFF EXACTLY 30 SECONDS AFTER I ENTER THE BLOODY LOO!?"   he snaps. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I... it must be a bug,"   I respond, wondering if security is extracting a portion of urine from the boss   as well... </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"HAVE YOU NOTED IT?" he   asks. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, we usually let the   user do that on the bugs noteboard" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"RIGHT! Where's that then?"   </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> My conscience is making   noises but, NO! I WANT THAT PRIZE! </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Ah, on the wall beside   the coffee machine" I respond, rewinding the videotape" </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> One thud later he's gone.   </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Two thuds later, they take   him away in a wraparound suit. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> And the worst of it is,   I'm still bored... </font><p> <HR><Center>  <HR>  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>BOFH '99.</B> A Mental   Lapse...</font>  <HR></Center><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Are you bloody MAD?" the   PFY asks as we return to the office after going a couple of rounds with a mixed   bag of technical and non-technical staff who'd ambushed us outside the elevator   on our way to lunch. "A bloody MEETING?!?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes," I murmur thoughtfully.   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You HATE meetings!" he   blurts. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, HATE is a strong   word. INTENSE dislike is more accurate. But that's beside the point -- I saved   us having to spend half an hour listening to their wandering thoughts on what   should be in our LDAP directory." </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Yes, it's true. Thanks   to some remark about information publishing by the Head of IT, there are two   parties lobbying for what'll end up in our new LDAP server. On the one hand   we have the individuals who believe that even their office phone number is their   own private info and not be published, while on the other we've got the 'privacy   'nudists' who want to bear all in the directory, listing home numbers, spouse's   name, birth date, in an effort to make the world a happier place." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"OK, but still, it's not   like you to call a meeting." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"In the past I've been   reluctant to attend meetings; however, that's only because I didn't initiate   the meeting concerned. THIS meeting, however, with a large number of disparate   attendees, will be worth its weight in 128 Meg DIMMS." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Come again?!?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Behold!" I cry, indicating   on my desktop the windows of the three separate meeting scheduler programs in   use in the company. "On the one hand we have the standalone meeting software,   on another, scheduling software built into a mail server, and lastly, some fly-by-night   product that Noah used which is so old it had a Y-ONE-K bug! And NONE of them   interoperate well. The first two disagree by an hour thanks to daylight savings   variations between the two machines, and the last one can handle hours, minutes,   days and months, but sadly not years, which means the fly-by-night data import/export   routine is bound to flag that the meeting time proposed is either a weekend,   or has a meeting scheduled in it -- the legacy of a meeting in some former year!"   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It doesn't get cleaned   out at the end of the year?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Nope!" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"OK, but this no-interoperation   means what?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"That after several abortive   attempts, THREE separate meeting times are going to be set, which I will have   to attend." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"But you HATE meetings!"   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes, but I LOVE watching   movies on my portable DVD player which, once I slap on a keyboard, will look   almost exactly like some cross between a palm and laptop! I'll be sure to 'type'   something every time one of them sounds like they've come to the point once,   or possibly twice per meeting. Meantime they'll be so busy 'discussing' their   point of view with the other attendees that I'll never see what I'm up to."   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What if they come to a   consensus?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Don't be silly -- these   are users! Besides, if it looks dodgy I'll throw the idea of retina scans and   bank account numbers onto the fire to keep things nice and hot." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Sooner or later they'll   agree!" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Puleeeeze!" I cry. "I'm   already running an LDAP to finger gateway, so when they eventually figure out   what they do and don't want I'll just remove that data from the finger information   data and we'll be back in business! After 'working solidly for a week to install   the new software' of course." </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> ...Three movies later...   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"So no consensus reached   then?" the boss asks, running a quick meeting post-mortem at mission control.   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, we almost reached   one. But then someone suggested listing previous convictions and medical conditions."   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Why the hell would we   want to do that?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, I believe the argument   was that as that information was supplied in a person's CV it might belong to   the company -- and someone might want to know if a co-worker had an alcohol   problem before they invited them to an Xmas shout." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"That's just ridiculous!"   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"That's what we decided   in the end. Then the same person asked if next-of-kin, blood type, then HIV   status should be listed for health and safety reasons..." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"They can't be serious!"   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well as it happened, we   decided against that eventually." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Do you think the next   meeting will iron out the wrinkles?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Bound to!" </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> ...Later... </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"So we're all agreed then?"   I ask the final meeting. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Murmurs of assent all round.   The PFY arrives with a parcel for me. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> From the mail order DVD   site. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Excellent, so we'll just   store name, room number, phone number, sexual preference, photo, nude photo   and breast size?" I say, slapping "Enemy of the State" into my 'laptop'. </font><p> <HR><Center>  <HR>  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>BOFH '99.</B> Medical   Matters.</font>  <HR></Center><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You look rough!" the PFY   chirps as I drag myself into work, a mere 26 hours late. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yeah, out with a Slave   Trader the night before last. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"And it was that bad you   took a sicky?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No. I don't take 'sickies'.   I was telecommuting." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yeah, right. Use the porcelain   modem, did you?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"That's quite enough of   that," I interject, still a little queasy after the tube ride. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"So what transpired?" the   PFY asks. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I only had a few ales."   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"A few?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, a few followed by   a few. And then a few more. But it was the curry that did for me. I just can't   do it any more. I have to face facts about my body's ability to leech toxins   from itself: I think I may be allergic to curry." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Don't say that!" the PFY   wails. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It's no use fighting it,"   I respond, "a man can stand only so many chicken vindaloos." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Are you sure it couldn't   be the booze?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No - I can have a couple   of lagers and wake up fine. But EVERY TIME I have a ruby, I feel ill in the   morning." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Could that be," the boss   interjects as he rolls into the office under a full head of administrative steam,   "because every time you have a curry you're plastered?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"There's a certain amount   of logic in that statement," I admit. "But the culprit has been identified..."   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"As booze," he states firmly.   "Anyway, you'll have a chance to put your theory to the test. We're all going   to lunch with a supplier, who wants to sell us low-cost disk by the Terabyte."   </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Oh well. After all, a curry   is a curry. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Our sales professional   burbles at the boss while the PFY and I power through a plate of pakoras washed   down with ginger beer. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"So you're selling SCSI,"   the PFY interjects. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No, not SCSI. Our topology   is based around a more robust..." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Proprietary?" I ask, smelling   blood in the water. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Ah, it's proven technology..."   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"DSSI!" I cry, going in   for the kill. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The torpedo hits, leaving   an 'uh'-shaped hole in his face. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"So, let's just recap what   we're NOT talking about," I continue, reeling off technical twaddle until the   boss wanders off to the little manager's room in despair. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We're not buying," the   PFY murmurs. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No," I concur. "We've   got all the old tech we need." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Hmm..." The salesman has   clearly faced this situation before. "Can I get you gentlemen anything?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, I'd like another   ginger beer for starters," the PFY smirks, pouring the remains of his last glass   down his gullet. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Me too," I agree, "and   hold the ginger." </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> TWO HOURS LATER... </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"So, let's go over this   one more time," the boss blurts. "We should buy a couple of Terabytes of this   disk to put on our old Vax system? But no-one uses it, it doesn't make sense!"   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes it does; listen,"   I explain softly - trying not to breathe in the direction of the boss, in case   he smells the evidence of the last 10 pints of my 'ginger' beer. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"There'll be fewer complaints   if no-one uses them." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Uh?" </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Looks like I'm going to   have to abandon logic and proceed direct to the jugular. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Think 'Mean Time Between   Failures'. Think 'Customer 'Uptime Expectation' and Delivery of Service'. 'Enhanced   Modularity'. Think 'Vendor Independence' and 'Phased Installation'. Think 'Replacement   Life Cycles'." I pray a silent prayer to the god of Management Buzzwords. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, I suppose if you   put it that way..." </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> His gracious defeat is   interrupted by a heavy-handed tap on the shoulder from the PFY, who has all   the symptoms of a bad case of liquor mortis. There's a steely look in his eye   and, before I can lay hands on him, he's up and at 'em. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Y'KNOW WHAT YUR PRBBLIM   ISH?" he slurs, giving the ISO-approved employee/employer signal for 'Please   disregard the following, I appear to be intoxicated'. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Hey! Isn't that Pamela   Anderson?" I cry, diverting everyone's attention while I kick the PFY's silence-knob.   Well, it shuts him up anyway. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The next day dawns and   I'm in a bad way. The PFY's in a bad way. Even the Boss is in a bad way (the   sales bloke paid the waiters at the curry house to slip shots of their special   Bolivian vodka (half Antifreeze) into the Boss' diet Tango). </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I take it back," the boss   whispers quietly. "I think I might be allergic to curry too." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Me too," the PFY agrees.   </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Next time we go to Luigi's.   You can't go wrong with a nice bowl of pasta. And a couple of lagers to wash   it down.. </font><p> <HR><Center>  <HR>  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>BOFH '99.</B> Staff Induction?...</font>  <HR></Center><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> So the boss rolls in one   morning with about 20 people in tow, bearing some 'good news' for us. The same   good news that bosses bring EVERY six months... </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Simon," he burbles pleasantly   (always a bad sign), "these are the new staff that we've acquired in the past   six months. I'm just running them through the IT induction course." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Course?" I ask. "As in,   obstacle?" </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The boss chuckles magnanimously.   "Simon fancies himself as a bit of a joker, ladies and gentlemen." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes," the PFY concurs,   slipping in from behind the assembled crowd of inductees, "like that time he   slipped the darkroom timer, some curly wires and a couple of distress flares   into your briefcase before you flew to Dublin..." </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The boss winces at the   mention - and I could almost swear his buttocks clenched in nervous recollection.   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"That wasn't very funny,"   he mutters. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, it made me laugh,"   the PFY cries. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Anyway," the boss continues,   glaring at the PFY. "I'd like you to show the group around the computer room."   </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> As a sign of good faith,   he hands over one of his most cherished possessions, a penlight laser pointer.   Weird - this is like Obi-Wan passing Darth his light sabre "for cleaning". </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Sadly, however, Obi-Wan's   exit destroys the moment as he makes his way into the doorjamb, ricocheting   into the corridor with all the panache of C3P0. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Still, there's trust being   displayed here for some reason. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> First, he gives me unsupervised   access to a busload of newbies AND he's handed over something he values highly.   Not that he doesn't value staff highly, of course, it's just that they're easier   to replace. The laser pointer cost 30 quid of HIS money, which is why it's so   disturbing to me when I accidentally - and I have witnesses to verify this -   drop it down the gap between the lift door and the lift shaft. Sniffle. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Meanwhile, the sheep are   following me, so I'd better put on a good show. "And this is our back-up system,"   I cry, indicating the monster robotic instrument as we move into the heart of   the computer room, just to dispel any rumours that we don't perform this vital   function. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What was that bin under   the back-up machine for?" a curious member of the audience asks once we leave   the inner sanctum and return to mission control. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> An interesting question   - I had asked the PFY to stop back-ups so the users wouldn't witness tapes being   'exported' from the jukebox into the bin. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Ah, that's to catch the   tapes that are going to off-site storage," I ad lib. "We're waiting for the   proper tape export cartridge, but in the interim..." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Then why did that other   guy just pour them all into the big bin?" he asks. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Security reasons." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"SECURITY?!" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Of course! If we shipped   our tapes out in a tape box they'd be a sitting duck for theft!" I cry. "This   way, no-one knows when the data's leaving the building." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, it's just been tipped   into a rubbish truck!" he responds, indicating a truck outside the window. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It only looks like a rubbish   truck," I sigh. "It wouldn't look at all convincing if a data storage company   collected our rubbish now would it?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"But they're collecting   everybody's rubbish," he continues. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Funny how you go off people   isn't it? </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes, yes, AGAIN, it would   look suspicious. Quite a lot of things aren't what they seem. This handscanner,   for example." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"That's not a hand scanner   - it's a panini toaster!" </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I sigh again, more deeply   this time. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"LOOKS like a panini toaster.   A volunteer from the audience please?" I ask. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Five seconds later... </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Ohmigoodness!" I cry (over   the screams). "It's a real panini toaster! The PFY must have installed the scanner   in the break room by mistake! And, oh no! The release catch is jammed!" </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Ten minutes later, when   waffle hand has been taken up to sick bay..."Any other questions?" </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The silence is deafening,   indicating another successful induction. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I take them back to the   boss so he can give them the IT summarisation speech, then wander back to mission   control. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Ah, just come to get my   pointer," he says. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> What the hell. "It's sitting   on top of the back-up stacker in the computer room," I respond, tapping away   at the console of the doors system. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"But my card's not working!"   he cries. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh yeah. Here, I'll let   you access it via the hand scanner..." </font><p> <HR><Center>  <HR>  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>BOFH '99.</B> Arty Murray   Arrives..</font>  <HR></Center><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Here we go again.... </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I smell trouble as soon   as I walk into the office. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It's 11:30 on the dot.   Well, no-one could possibly expect me to get in early, given that I'd just come   back from a trade show and that I'd had to go back home first to drop off my   ill-gotten gains. Or, put more officially, the advanced, top-of-the-range kit   that's going to be used as a testbed for advanced interactive digital multimedia   (and any other buzzwords that spring to mind and sound appealing on investment   proposals) services. Right now the test plan seems to involve rigging up the   kit so that we can show the latest DVDs to selected chums (for a small fee,   naturally) but that's the nature of draft plans. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> On arrival, I'm gasping   for a cup of coffee. I function only once I've had a shot of the strongest Java.   The PFY keeps moaning that the amount of the stuff I drink is leaving me totally   wired, although as far as I'm concerned, I'm completely 802.11 until I've had   my first couple of shots of caffeine in the morning. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The PFY is looking worried   as he meets me by the door of the office. "The boss wants to see you urgently,"   he says, jerking a none-too-clean thumb in the direction of our newly-appointed   lord and master. "He's been yelling for you all morning." </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> That is a worrying sign.   Our boss has been part of the merry fray for only a few weeks but there is every   sign that he's boss type 37b (knows bugger all about technology and spends so   much of his time crawling up to the chief executive and the head beancounter   that he's forgotten how to do anything that actually resembles work). </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> His ignorance is staggering.   I managed to spend several hours the other day playing Doom with the PFY because   I persuaded him that he and I were testing the Dial-up Object Oriented Machine.   And then there's the time that a contractor (who, by some amazing stroke of   chance, bore a marked resemblance to my cousin) persuaded the boss that Arcnet   was tomorrow's magic technology, and that he really should invest in some state-of-the-art   kit that the contractor just happened to have in the back of his Escort. Personally,   I can't wait for the audit this quarter, particularly when they find the e-mail   that I "sent" to Mr. 37b warning him against the deal. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> But that's something to   look forward to in the future, I'm more concerned at the moment with what the   boss is thinking of now. The PFY is right to look concerned; any meeting in   the morning involves what we call a BLI (before lager intake) idea - the worst   sort to have, as the thoughts simply don't flow so freely as PADOTF (pissed   and dribbling on the floor) ones. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Ah, Simon," beams 37b   (a bad sign) when I eventually make my way into his oak-panelled domain. "I've   been thinking" (a really bad sign). "The network's been running rather sluggishly   lately and it needs a bit of a tweaking" (an extremely bad sign - you never   want to hear the word 'tweaking' from someone who even has trouble changing   the channel on the TV). "I think it might be an idea for someone to come into   the office and have a look at ways in which we could improve the network". Yes,   it's an idea, but I'm not entirely sure it's one I'd like to entertain or, for   that matter, one which is likely to prolong his status as a living, breathing   carbon-based lifeform. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Anyway, of course the network's   been a bit slow recently. Doesn't he realise just what demands real-time video   has for networked bandwidth, even if you multicast it properly? (And anyway,   those video pictures of the marketing director and his PA in the sickroom, after   she was "taken ill" at a company bash, were well worth a few megabits per second   down the backbone, so to speak). The last thing I need is some snotty-nosed,   toad-faced consultant coming in here, taking a cursory look at our systems before   filing a hastily-flung together report that completely rips off the company.   That's my job. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I'm suddenly aware that   the boss is still speaking. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"...and at the show I met   this very interesting chap. Told me that he would be happy to take a look at   the way our network was constructed, said that if he couldn't think of ways   of saving money, we wouldn't have to pay him. I told him that we were future-proofing   our network by using a new technology called Thinwire and his eyes lit up. I   think he was impressed that we were so advanced - he even said that there wasn't   much he could teach me." </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> This gets worse. And not   just because the Boss *knows* the word thinwire - let alone thinks I'd let it   in the place... </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"So I've invited this guy   over tomorrow to have a look at the way we do things. His name's Arty Murray   and you should help him in any way you can." </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> ARTY MURRAY!! </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The man of legend. It's   the first time that I've come anywhere near an encounter with the Bastard Consultant   from Hell, and it's not a prospect that I'm looking forward to. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It's time to formulate   a plan. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> To be continued... </font><HR><Center>  <HR>  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>BOFH '99.</B> The End?.</font>  <HR></Center><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It's with a heavy heart   that I secure myself in the control room to write these lines. The reader will   have to forgive my writing style as this is my first attempt at writing. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I have, for some time,   been aware of my supervisor's habit of recounting our adventures to the readers   of Network Week, and feel that it would be remiss of me, as his faithful assistant,   not to recount this sorry tale. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It was a typical Friday   morning. I was engaged in some user education in accordance with the Recommended   Daily User Allowance of electricity. My 'tutorial' was interrupted by the cessation   of mains supply to the desktop. Freed from the grip of electricity, the user   escaped past the Bastard, who had his finger on the now-open circuit breaker.   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Much work on?" he asked,   somewhat distracted. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Nothing," I respond, indicating   the recently departed user. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Then it makes it all the   easier for me to propose you sneak away for a couple of days." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"This isn't that camping   holiday joke again, is it?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Afraid not. Ever heard   the name Arty Murray?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No...Hang on - isn't he   the guy who calls himself a 'network artist'?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Piss artist more like.   He slimes in on a boss or two at a trade show then, with their permission, does   remote probes of WANs and LANs (as an 'independent security consultant') then   combines this information with stuff sneaked to him by the management contact   concerned." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"And...?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"And, inevitably, he fabricates   some security vulnerability and recommends outsourcing ALL IT operations to   some crap start-up company that he's associated with that couldn't ping localhost   and get a response. THEN, when that company goes belly-up, snakes the job for   himself. Thing is, you might never know your job was at risk! If I could beat   that man, if I could free computing society of him, I'd be prepared to turn   to some more placid line in life - user support, helpdesk manning, morris dancing   at televised events." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Surely not!" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Nah, just taking the piss.   But he's a menace, and he's been HERE. I've tracked him over the past few days.   We've had our run-ins, and now he's coming for me and mine. It's personal!"   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What are you going to   do?" I asked. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Do? Elementary, my dear   PFY! We're going to leave the place unattended for a couple of days until he   reveals himself. He won't be able to resist the chance of playing with the kit."   </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> And so we did. Booking   two tickets to the Third World (Luton), we made to absent ourselves from the   office. Instead we snuck back and fired up the Emergency Operations Centre on   the 6th floor, passing the time aiming our disused sat dishes at our rival's   receivers and sending high-gain bursts at them. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Jeez!" the Bastard cried   on the second day, halfway through our Indian takeaway. "LOOK!" he cried, pointing   to a flashing red icon on the building monitor. "It's him, in the ROB faller!"   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"ROB faller? What's a faller?"   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It's the opposite of a   riser," the Bastard snaps. "Where the waste water and sewage go. To stop people   going in there I break one of the sewer seals every year. That, combined with   the lack of floor grilles, provides a treacherous drop, which is usually enough   to stop even the most curious in their tracks." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Why?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"'Cos that's where I keep   my stash of liberated kit and non-petty cash. You know I don't trust banks with   ill-gotten gains." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"ROB faller?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"There's four fallers in   the building, Left-In-Front, Right-In-Front, Left-Out-Back, Right-Out-Back."   </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"So what's in the Right   Out Back Faller?" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Dosh. All my dosh. Years   of it. Stuffed into what, to all intents and purposes, looks like a large sewer   line." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Arty Murray's found it?"   I gasped. </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It would appear so. I'd   best investigate!" </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I'll come with you." </font><p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No, you stay here. I don't   want anyone thinking that both of us have left the office." With that the Bastard,   armed with his torch-shaped cattle prod and a set of jump leads, strode out.   </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I waited for some time.   I fired up the CCTV monitors to follow his progress - to no avail. The CCTV   circuits were dead. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Sprinting to the corner   of the building with only a battery-powered stapler for protection, I found   a half-open door, marked "Reichenbach - Buildings Maintenance", obviously some   form of pun. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Opening the door fully,   I saw evidence of a struggle, a splintered rail here, a drop of blood there.   </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> There was worse to come.   A floor and a half below, caught on a pipe fitting, I saw a strip of cloth that   could only have come from the Bastard's T-shirt. </font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I gazed into the black   abyss and shouted his name. My voice echoed back at me, but no-one answered.   </font><p> <HR>
