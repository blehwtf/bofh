I   ask in all innocence, knowing full well that my conscience is clear. (In other   words, it was the Pimply-faced Youth.) </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Which of you told the   Welsh IT consultant he'd have to heat the 8mm tapes up in a toaster before he   could recover their billing database from it?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I have no idea what you're   talking about!" I cry, furthering my claim of innocence without implicating   the PFY in any way. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Don't give me that crap!   You almost set the office on fire last night after you told him to put a ream   of printer paper on top and tape the toaster lever down!" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I did no such thing!"   I shout, mentally toasting the PFY's ingenuity. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Ten minutes later and the   PFY and I are left to our own devices. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well done," I tell the   PFY, once I'm sure we're not being observed. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What do you mean? I was   just about to congratulate YOU!" the PFY burbles. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"So you're saying it wasn't   you?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No!" the PFY blurts. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Then who the hell was   it?" I wonder out loud. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"There's no way to tell?"   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Don't be silly. Grab the   voice recorder tapes from yesterday while I crank up the phone logs." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What phone logs? I thought   we only recorded the trading lines." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"As far as anyone else   is concerned, we don't keep phone logs - it's not possible." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"And as far as we're concerned?"   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Every call, duration,   and destination plus its position in the voice recorder tapes. And as for the   tapes - liberal use of the muting functions makes it appear that we're only   recording the traders." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"And in actual fact?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"All but one line is potentially   recorded..." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"All but one?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The one in the comms cupboard   labelled "Faxmodem" that we use for our international personal calls." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A mere quarter hour later   we've tracked the offending incoming call from Wales. A quick earful of the   conversation identifies the offender as the latest recruit to the helpdesk -   one who, apparently, had all the hallmarks of a servile practitioner of computing   aid at her interview. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I place a call through   to the helpdesk operator concerned, introduce myself and play back the recording   to her. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A non-committal silence   greets my revelations while the PFY scans the access-card database to put a   face to the name. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Ah, I'll take this one   if you like," he blurts, tilting the screen away from me so I can't see the   results of his look-up. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> This would have worked   had I not installed PC-Anywhere with a permanent window to his screen. A glance   is more than enough to determine the source of the PFY's new-found liaison-based   altruism. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I s'pose I can go and   fix Carole's screen while you're doing it,"I respond. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"There's nothing wrong   with Carole's screen!" the PFY cries, well aware that my exposure to Carole,   his long-term love interest, at this juncture, could prove extremely painful   to him. Especially if I were to drop the phrase "debriefing the new helpdesk   stunner" in response to her enquiries on his whereabouts... </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No, but better safe than   sorry. Off you go, I'll handle it." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You bastard," he mutters   in defeat. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"In the flesh, in your   home directory, and rifling through your e-mail!" I cry, starting my victory   walk to the helpdesk area. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A quick interview with   the woman concerned reveals a kindred spirit - a config geek, who only took   the helpdesk role because it paid the bills... </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"So you're not too pleased   with the users?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Just the Welsh ones. They've   got no tech support and all their equipment still has luggage labels from the   ark." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yeah, it's the filter-down   approach. All our old stuff goes to the Scotland office, all their old stuff   goes to Wales." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It's a pain in the arse   and having a consultant who can't tell one end of a power cable from the other   is too." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"But there is a way forward."   I respond, outlining a plan that's forming in my head... </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Two days later the PFY   is browsing the boss's outgoing e-mail when... </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Bloody hell!" he blurts."That   helpdesk woman's been transferred to tech support Wales! They must have found   out about the phone calls. That's cruel." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No," I respond. "She wanted   to go. She's worked out that once she gets the place shipshape and puts some   new kit in, she can telecommute from London..." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Our conversation is interrupted   by the entry of the boss. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Just thought I'd come   in and apologise. It seems I was a bit hasty the other day in accusing you of   sabotaging the Welsh office." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh yes?" I respond. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes, it appears that the   technical consultant in Wales was a pyromaniac - security caught him last night   spraying lighter fluid in the back of their apps server. His excuse was that   someone from the helpdesk had called and said the CPU heatsink was getting too   cold." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Terrible." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I know. Anyway, just thought   I'd fill you in," he sighs, leaving the room... </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Onward VBGN!" I cry. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"VBGN?!" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Virtual Bastard Global   Network. My Master Plan!" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Uh-Ohhh..." </font><P> <P><HR><CENTER>  <H2><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The BOFH and PFY attend     a 'bored' meeting, everyone gets bladdered and the boss gets to 'chair' an     assembly of overheated shareholders... </font></H2></CENTER><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> So the PFY and I have been roped into going to a shareholders' meeting as technical standby in case someone asks the boss a difficult question that he can't manage (like, "where's the space bar?"). <P> There's a stuffy half-time wine and nibbles event to ensure a cheery mood   and that the shareholders' views match those of current management. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Mmm, an '89 Cab. Sav.   if I'm not much mistaken," a distinguished gent to my left burbles to a fellow   member of the Old School Tie classes. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I think you'll find it's   actually a '90 Cab. Sav.," his counterpart chuckles knowingly. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Really?" the Pimply-faced   Youth blurts. "I thought it was an '88 Ford Grenada - the Ghia version with   the leather seats and the wood panelling!" </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> You have to forgive him   - he always gets a little boisterous after being locked in a meeting for over   an hour. I'm a little fidgety myself... </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I drag him away from civilised   company while simultaneously tampering with the airconditioning (courtesy of   an RF transmitter hanging out of the back of my personnel disorganiser). Within   10 minutes the place is heating up and dehumidifying nicely and all attempts   at resetting the airconditioning meet with failure. (Which is the price you   pay for leaving the unit's remote PIN number at the factory default.) After   some whispered conversation with the catering staff, the CEO okays anything   that'll stop the parched shareholders getting nasty. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> And wouldn't you know it   - there's 12 cases of lager packed in the boardroom's catering chiller, awaiting   the company yacht club's victory celebration... </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Twelve cases of ice-cold   beer later, the meeting is coming along nicely. Feeling magnanimous, the shareholders   have demanded that management approve an across-the-board pay rise for all salary,   wage and contract workers - effective immediately. Striking while the iron is   hot, I get them to get management sign-off on 100 "urgent desktop upgrades"   of machines with "all the fruit". The boss, who would normally head this off   at the pass - also known for his lack of tolerance to even mild amounts of alcohol,   is circulating hot-off-the-press photocopies of his backside - still thankfully   encased in boxer shorts. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Security moves in gently   about halfway through the "long jump" event (an occupied wheelie chair pushed   full tilt up a ramp made by breaking the legs off one end of the boardroom table).   </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Apparently a participant   'abandoned chair' before lift-off resulting in two broken windows - one in the   boardroom, and one in a black cab parked below. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The next day rumours are   rife - the word has got around the building about who's to thank for a projected   pay increase. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Feeling like the modern   equivalents of Robin Hood, the PFY and I accept thanks humbly. Lao Tsu would   be proud of us. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Our fame is to be shortlived,   however, as there's an emergency shareholder meeting to put right the excesses   of the previous night. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It's bad. The annulments   are coming in fast, and we arrive just in time to hear our upgrade plan sink   beneath the waters of a corporate cover-up. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Ah," I interject, as the   motion is put, "would this be a bad time to mention that I've already ordered   the approved equipment last night?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well un-order it then!"   a voice advises. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Then we'd have to pay   a restocking penalty of 10 per cent..." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Ten per cent being a better   loss than 100 per cent, the motion is passed and the PFY and I take off to cancel   the order. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"But you didn't put in   an order!" the PFY blurts, knowing that the only real work I did last night   was negotiate the revolving door to get to a cab. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No, no, but when I order   10 machines, to be charged to us as 'Restocking Fee', delivered to the Welsh   office..." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh!" The PFY cries. "The   Virtual Bastard Global Network is one step nearer!" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What Virtual Bastard Global   Network?" the boss asks, stepping into the office. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Virtual Bastard Global   Network?" I ask innocently. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes...what you were talking   about just then." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh, you mean the Virtual   Bartercard Global Network?" I ask, clutching at the first straw "For...electronic   transactions?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No, I think I got it right   the first time. You engineered all this for new machines for some Global Network   of your own design. I think the shareholders might like to hear this." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I'm shocked. The boss,   who normally couldn't put two and two together and get a number less than 22,   has hit the nail on the head. He knows too much. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> While I'm twiddling with   my personnel disorganiser, the boss tells the PFY to extract himself from the   security console and join him and me in the boardroom. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Pleading claustrophobia   in lifts, I take the stairs. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Ten minutes and three floors   later, the boss wheezes to a halt outside the boardroom, having lost his asthma   inhaler down the stairwell when the PFY accidentally bumped into him. We open   the door and enter. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Thank God you got the   door open!" someone gasps as the wave of heat hits us. "The door's locked from   the inside and the aircon's on the blink again. Don't close it!" </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Twelve replacement cases   of beer later, we're still locked in, surveying the hole in the window that   the boss left when winning the "long jump" event. True, it might have looked   as if he didn't want to be strapped into the chair, but I can assure you that   he was excited enough to be whispering "Wheeeee" the whole time... </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> And he got a cab ride home   out of it too... </font><P> <P><HR><CENTER>  <H2><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> When the building is     repainted in the lurid colour scheme of 'Teletubby Land', there is only one     way to restore it to its former grey glory... </font></H2></CENTER><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I'm coming into the office in time for morning tea when I glimpse a sight on the ground floor that I have to share with the PFY. <P> I am rapid-dialling my mobile phone before I'm halfway across the foyer. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Hello, Nigerian Embassy,"   the PFY answers, using this week's wrong-number diversion scheme. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You'll never guess what   they're doing on the ground floor!" I chuckle. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Painting the walls radiation   orange?"he asks. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh. Of course, you've   got CCTV, what was I thinking?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes, and not just that!"   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, do you want the   good news or the bad news?" the PFY asks, in a playful manner. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The good news..." I respond,   taking the lift for a change. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The good news is that   there's only one bit of bad news." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I see, and the bad news   is?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The painters started on   the fourth floor last night." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"How bad is it?" I ask   as the lift doors open, answering my question. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I am now staring at an   office that looks like the inside of a heat lamp. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The boss strolls over,   smiling benevolently - or is that malevolently? </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Awful, isn't it?" he asks   pastily. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Ah! What I'd mistaken for   a smile of benevolence was in fact a wince of distress. Easy mistake to make   with the boss only recently back from sick leave. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Who did it?" I ask. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The building owners,"   the boss responds. "Apparently in response to the request of senior management.   But that's not the worst. Stores just rang to say our purple carpet's arrived."   </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I choke down my gag reflex   and manage to utter, "Why?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Because this study," the   PFY cries, holding up a management rag, "says that certain colours are more   conducive to an energetic workplace." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I thought that was pale   blues and pinks?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No," the PFY responds,   recalling from memory sections of the article. "Pale blues and pinks are conducive   to a calm atmosphere - which, incidentally, are the colours of our office."   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You're bloody joking!"   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No. Oh, and I lied about   there only being one bit of bad news." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I rip down to my office   to investigate. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes, yes, I see what you   mean," I say, relaxing into my chair. "It is a little calmer than the harsh   metallic white of before. It's almost soothing in a way." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It's not good to stay   in here," the PFY comments. "It's dangerous - remember the negative ion generators...?"   </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> How could I forget a former   management plan to pump negative ions into our building in an attempt to make   the PFY and I consider customer relations more. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The computer room!" I   cry. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The PFY, the boss and I   head to the clinical safety of the computer room's harsh greyish walls. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Much better!" </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Through the viewing window   in the fire escape door I see the IT workers going through their routines, unaware   of the harmful effects of the wall colour. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Poor bastards!" the PFY   cries. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It's too late for them!   We've got to think of ourselves!" the boss blurts, echoing my exact thoughts.   </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> (Which is a worry. Come   to think of it, the boss's room has always been a bluish pinky colour...) </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What to do..." I murmur,   looking to see the boss's level of commitment, "what to do..." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> This goes on for another   couple of minutes until the grey affects the boss's mind and an idea pops out.   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"A fire!" he cries, as   I make a mental note to give future bosses an hour a week of computer room therapy..."No!   It'd never work - the extinguishers would cut in immediately." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"True!" I respond, "and   all that water on the semi-cured paint..." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It'd never wash it all   off!" the PFY blurts. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It doesn't have to wash   it off! It just has to make it patchy!" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"...requiring a repaint!"   the PFY finishes. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> While the PFY and the boss   complete their Laurel and Hardy act, I set to work removing a panel from high   on the wall. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What are you doing?" the   boss asks in confusion. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"A small fire, while bloody   dangerous, is not the answer, nor..." I add, silencing the PFY's next sentence,   "is a big fire. We need a small fire, in the right place." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"And where's that?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"In..." I cry, ripping   off the plate to reveal a blocked-off galvanised iron duct, "the air-conditioning   system." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It'll blow the smoke all   over the building!" The PFY cries, enlightened once more. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Friends, countrymen,"   I cry, "lend me your jackets and shoes!" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Will we get them back?"   The boss asks, stupidly. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I pry open the ducting,   stuff in the jackets, shoes, some tape listings, some tapes, a gallon of tape   head cleaner and, what the hell, the boss's wallet (old habits die hard). </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Halon!" I cry. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The PFY dashes over and   switches the fire alarm on. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What the hell are you   doing?!" the boss cries in terror. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Nothing happens. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"There's a wiring 'fault',"   the PFY says. "The fire alarm switch holds off the Halon, while the Halon-hold-off   switch turns it on." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"One of yours?" the boss   asks. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You're too kind," I smirk,   chucking the lit matches into the ducting and closing the panel. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Quicker than you can say   "Is that the fire alarm?" the fire sensor board is lighting up like a Christmas   tree and the sound of alarms echo from all corners. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"To the new colour scheme!"   I cry, lifting one of the raised-floor tiles and pulling out three lagers chilled   to a crisp 17 degrees... </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Cheers!" the boss and   PFY cry in unison. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> And they say that orange   inspires teamwork... </font><P> <P><HR><CENTER>  <H2><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Does the BOFH know anything     about the disappearance of the telecomms manager, his lawnmower and the wife     he's 'grass-widowed'? </font></H2></CENTER><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It's been a quiet morning for me. <P> A cynic might suggest this is because I patched the helpdesk calls through   to the marketing manager who cut up rough last week when we were slow to upgrade   his PC. He just didn't seem to understand that Doom does normally take precedence   over RAM upgrades, although 71 callers all claiming that the network was running   slow might have forced some wisdom into his brain. <P> Even though we've put them back on-line, the users are still restless and   somewhat puzzled at the 'teething troubles' with the new coffee machines. You   see, as part of the rather sudden refit the offices have undergone (if somewhat   abortive, in colour terms), the powers that be decided to replace the tired   old coffee machines with snazzy new ones. <P> This choice came as a pleasant surprise down here in Networks & Systems. When   the previous drinks machines were installed, the PFY and I tried the usual procedure   of reprogramming the 'tea' button to deliver vegetable soup, and the 'vegetable   soup' button to deliver boiled Hoover-bag contents. Sadly, this approach made   the end product rather more attractive than the real thing, so we admitted defeat   and put everything back to its default settings. <P> Now we have these new machines, however, the users can actually tell that   what they're getting isn't what they were asking for, thus making the whole   reprogramming concept worthwhile. And the hedgehog broth is receiving some favourable   reviews, not to mention a degree of mirth from those who are convinced the labels   are only a bit of fun, and it's really just beef soup. <P> The phone rings and I answer it. This is partly because we're bored and partly   because the the PFY has clocked the CLI and decided that the caller is good-looking   enough to warrant attention - I only wait until the 18th ring. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I need e-mail installed   on my notebook," the monitor speaker of the call recorder proclaims, rather   too confidently if you ask me. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The PFY checks the asset   register and confirms that the user is as chained to the desk as they come,   and hence has only the regulation issue 8MB 386 desktop running NT Workstation.   "What notebook might that be?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The one I'm using to write   my dissertation." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Dissertation?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes, I'm doing a psychology   course on day-release." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"So it's not exactly a   company machine, then?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, no, it's my boyfriend's,   but the dissertation is relevant to my job, and the company's paying my college   fees." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Sorry, but if it's not   a company machine, we can't connect it to the network." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"That's okay, I connected   it to the network already. It just needs the e-mail package installed." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh, how kind of you to   save us the trouble." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The PFY realises why I   have been pointing for some time to a previously unidentified blob on the management   console, which I have identified via SNMP as a top-end, not-released-till-December   pre-Alpha beast of a notebook. Rumour has it there are only a dozen in the country   so she must have been doing some serious extra-curricular work to blag it. Tentatively,   I start to explore the machine over the LAN. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Hey," the PFY exclaims   in mock excitement into the mouthpiece, "you're the one I've heard about - there   are only 11 of those in the country, aren't there?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, yes, 12 in fact."   </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A muffled bang from the   speaker indicates that it is indeed the model that is reputed to suffer from   a rather explosive Desktop Management Interface (DMI) - otherwise known as the   Detonate Machine Interrupt-problem. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Nope. Definitely 11,"   chuckles the PFY as he replaces the receiver basking in the warm glow of a job   well done. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> At this point, the boss   casually strolls in (we've obviously been too friendly, as he's lost that cautious   look, the nervous tic and the tendency to look under his car before opening   the doors - though he still wears rubber gloves when handling doorknobs). He's   looking for the telecomms manager, who has apparently gone AWOL. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It's very sad that he's   gone missing, I'm sure," I assure the boss, "but what with all this voice-data   convergence and stuff, does it really matter?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"That's not the point!"   fumes the boss, in his this-is-really-important-honest voice. "He hasn't been   seen for some time and his wife is complaining the grass is getting long!" </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I flick open the Yellow   Pages at 'Psychiatric Clinics' and hand it to the boss. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> He looks quizzically at   me. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It's amazing isn't it?"   I start thinking aloud. "There are some strange people who think that PBXs will   always be so difficult as to warrant an in-house expert all of their own. Who   think that phones on desks are a right, not a privilege. Who think network operators   are the scum of the earth because they have scheduled downtimes. Who don't realise   that you can deliver 30,000 volts to the voice-comms frame without even dropping   a cell on the fibre LAN running past it." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> By now, the boss knows   not to waste his breath on expressions like "I knew you were up to something   last week!" or "Is he all right?", concentrating intently instead for several   seconds on the volume in his hand. He snaps it shut, drops it back in the drawer,   and smiles decisively. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"So he won't be needing   his lawnmower back for a bit, then?" </font><P> <P><HR><CENTER>  <H2><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The BOFH steps in to     help with a staff identity crisis, and the PFY drives a wedge between systems     maintenance and the boss </font></H2></CENTER><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> So I'm in early to do some systems maintenance. <P> Well, when I say early, I mean 9:15am - just when everyone's established their   connections to the database and applications server. <P> My console beeps to indicate that the required 200 interactive sessions have   been reached and I start my programme to ensure the reinstatement of overtime   rates... <P> I echo "Axeme" to /dev/kmem and the system goes down faster than a Clinton   intern. <P> As expected, the boss hurtles out of his office like a beige tornado, only   to be repelled with a resounding 'thud' by the wedge I'd kicked under the door   earlier, in response to the new "Fire and Safety" policy of electronically unlocking   certain swipe-card controlled doors during working hours "for ease of access".   Unfortunately this means that every half-wit from PR thinks it's an open invitation   to come up and talk about someone "hacking their username". <P> Talk of the devil; a PR geek slips in. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Told you we should have   got a bigger wedge," the PFY murmurs. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Hi," the PR bod cries.   "I think my username has been hacked!" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No it hasn't," I respond   without looking up. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It has!

A thinly   disguised plan to grab more quiddage." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I hardly think that's   true!" the boss comments, entering the room now his sense of balance is restored.   "It just cuts down on photographic double-handling." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"How's that?" the PFY asks.   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Because the PR department   keeps an electronic archive of photographs of staff members which they give   to the press." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes," I comment, "like   when one of the beancounters wins Profit-and-Loss Adjuster of the Year Award..."   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I..." the boss starts,"...anyway,   that's not why I'm in here. Why's the Apps server down?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Apps Server..." I mutter   looking at the maintenance whiteboard."Yes, it's got routine maintenance scheduled   - see," </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I point to the lettering   thereon. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You're supposed to schedule   that sort of thing out of hours!" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, I'd like to, but   you asked us to watch the overtime." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes, but I didn't mean   for maintenance on crucial machines!" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You did!" I cry, reminding   him of events recently past.

I start. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No buts, get it up!" </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Pseudo-reluctantly, I remote-boot   the server. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Which only leaves the problem   of the recent influx of PR types. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A quick scan of the PR   network finds the right PC and, thanks to lax group administrator security and   default passwords, within a minute I'm browsing the profile of the attached   photo-label printer. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> And back me up on read-protected   media if the printer doesn't have several uploadable photo overlays to choose   from, including the words "security", "contractor", "cleaner", "board member"   etc. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The next day a resounding   thud announces the boss's arrival.

The   PFY lets him in. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What's behind this?" he   asks. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It's a photo-id of an   accountant," I respond. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Why is the word Beancounter   printed over his photo?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Because it's his job?"   I ask. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"If that's the case, how   many Wankers are employed in the building?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I wouldn't like to speculate   on that one..." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Seventy three apparently.   Twenty-seven Beancounters, 35 Tossers and one Bumbag.

"I suppose they'll have to be reprinted." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"They can't!" the boss   cries "Security has run out of blanks and can't get new stock for a fortnight..."   </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The next day there's some   upset when security gives the new cards to the great unwashed.

The assistant head of personnel is there, purely coincidentally   of course. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, I'd like to do something   about it," he responds, "but the company has fairly strict guidelines on dismissing   employees due to medical conditions..." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"So she's here to stay?"   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Unless there's some disciplinary   issue that you'd like to raise?" personnel replies. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Other than she's crap?"   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"She is not crap.

Bugger, I've just set the fire   alarm test off by accident!" </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The PFY, meantime, is beating   his keyboard senseless in a very convincing manner while our two visitors make   for the door. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Be careful!" I cry, "I   can't remember whether I locked out the lift system or not, and if I did - Ooooh,   is that an Armani suit?!" </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The next day the PFY and   I meet with the head of personnel, the boss, and the head of dept. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A calm knock on the door   announces the arrival of our personal psychiatric advisor. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I don't believe you've   met our psychiatric advisor, Doctor Brian Analpeeper - Phd in Abnormal Psychology   from the Bognor Regis Polytechnic." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Good morning gentlemen,"   Brian starts. "I have here the diagnoses of my patients' conditions which, I   must say, appear to have been aggravated by the inability of their superegos   to express their thoughts about current management decisions..." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Brian goes on to explain   that yesterday's unfortunate power and systems outage etc. is all a result of   our inability to get to the boss because of the new secretary. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"They're just a couple   of freeloading layabouts who are milking the company dry," the boss snaps angrily.   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I feel at this juncture   I must ask for some time alone with my clients to discern any mental harm that   your comments have caused them." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What the hell?!" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"My clients are sensitive   people. Who knows what your comments may have done to their delicate psyches.   This meeting may accelerate a whole new set of problems, uncovering repressed   memories of employee abuse." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What?!" the boss cries,   dangerously close to blowing a major blood vessel. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Wait," the head of personnel   interjects, recognising an escalating situation when he's in one. "We'll transfer   her." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"To stamp-licking in the   mail room?" I ask evilly. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We have a franking machine,"   the boss comments dryly. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Not for much longer,"   the PFY comments. "I think I feel a bout of frank rage coming on." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Interesting manifestation   of trauma," Brian comments. "Well, I see no need for my remaining here." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You bastard!" the boss   snarls before yelping as Brian's briefcase crushes his hand. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Sorry," Brian explains.   "I'm a recovering briefcase rage sufferer." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Amazing what a psychiatrist   can find out, if you pay him enough... </font><P> <P><HR><CENTER>  <H2><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The BOFH is fazed by     the remote working boom - but not for long. He and the PFY find more devious     ways to keep the Operations beer fund topped up. </font></H2></CENTER><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> There are times when I believe that the PFY and I are the only ones who actually spend any time in the office these days. <P> There is a distinct tendency toward home working, which is bad news indeed. <P> Bad news in a number of ways. First, there are fewer people in the office   to admire the support 'efforts' of the PFY and myself; this, in itself, implies   a reduction in the level of available victims. <P> Second, for every user on the remote access server, we lose 64Kbps (before   compression) of our PRI Quake connection to the US arm of the company. <P> Finally, and most importantly, remote access equals more user moans. <P> You see, remote access is hard to use. It involves not only using Windows   NT's user interface, but also a modem and a phone line. It also involves calling   the right number in order to gain access to the company network. <P> Difficult, you may think. Except the reason we run NT Workstation is because   we can lock everything down tighter than...well, just think of the anatomy of   waterfowl. And the modem is internal to the PC, so they can't get the wires   wrong when they connect it up. <P> And the phone line is Araldited into the modem card, so they can't put the   wrong end in the wrong hole. And the other end has a big green label saying   "Plug this end into a telephone socket". Made of steel. And the dial-up number   is hard-coded into the modem software. And it's even the right number on ten   per cent of the machines. <P> So what exactly is it that these people find so hard? These are people who,   by and large, can figure out which way round to sit on a toilet. Who - with   the exception of the senior purchasing controller - know which end of a biro   goes on to the paper. Who somehow passed a test and are legally allowed to drive   a big heavy car with a big engine and sharp edges to work but still can't figure   out how to plug a power cord into the only socket it'll fit into in the back   of a computer. <P> For example, a call the PFY answered by mistake the other day: </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I can't dial into the   network." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Really? Is the modem plugged   in?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes, that was the problem   last time, so I made sure it was okay today." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Have you been able to   connect at all?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, I got in yesterday."   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Have you changed anything?"   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Really?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"NO!" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Try it again now." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Okay...hang on...it says   'no dialtone'." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"How many phone lines do   you have in your house?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Just one. Why?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">>CLICK</font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> But it's not all bad. Remote   access users do have their uses, of course. You see, a while ago the beancounters   decided to ban people from charging their home phone bills to expenses. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> They figured that if people   couldn't be bothered to come into the office, they weren't about to pay. Therefore,   we in IT decided to be very friendly to the poor little cherubs who were too   delicate to face a daily commute and give them an 0800 number to dial into.   </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Sadly, something appears   to have gone wrong with the local cable franchise's phone billing system. Somehow   </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I don't seem to be getting   the bill for all these allegedly freefone remote access calls. Yet I've heard   rumours of relationship rockiness becoming rife among our remote access friends.   Something to do with wives finding 800-per-quarter phone bills full of itemised,   premium rate numbers with suspicious-sounding names...whatever the case, the   Operations beer fund appears to be ticking up nicely at a rate of 44p per minute   (35p off-peak). </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Not only this, but the   management are starting to catch on to the fact that there might be something   in the remote-user thing after all. Something called hot-desking, I'm told.   </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Manager theory goes along   the lines of: if someone isn't there, I'm getting charged for their bit of the   office, so let's put someone else in there and save money. It is, of course,   perfectly logical to take on extra people on thirty grand a year in order to   fully utilise eighty quid's worth of square footage. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Anyhow, as the PFY and   I gaze out of the window we can see a whole load of big vans and men carting   into the building what look suspiciously like cubicle partitions. A suspicion   looms... </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I wonder... </font><P><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Three o'clock comes, and   it's time for the PFY and I to adjourn to the cosy meeting room on the corner   that has a full-sized pool table and serves such a nice pint of Stella. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> As we battle our way across   the yard, weaving a path through the head-butting and the fist-fights, we find   ourselves musing about how ironic it all is that one of the junior programmers   should have discovered the old cubicle-allocation application I wrote five years   ago for the previous management (most of whom have now, sadly, passed on or   checked into rehab units). </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> For some reason hot-desking   didn't work then, either. </font><P> <P><HR><CENTER>  <H2><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The Operations room     is lit up like a set of traffic lights when the head beancounter asks the     BOFH and the PFY to account for their time... </font></H2></CENTER><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> An edict has come down from on high that we have to account for our time. It's all about accountability, internal recharging and all that jazz. Seems the boss has been getting grief for having such a big cost centre, so he's decided to make us into a profit centre by making people pay for our services. The financial director fell for the idea and appears to be writing us some terms, conditions and SLA clauses. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We pay how much per hour?"   </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The PFY is startled by   my exclamation, though realisation dawns as he looks at my screen-scrape of   the financial director's Word window. It seems that our department loses money   should my humble assistant or I be late fixing someone's machine. To the tune   of a grand an hour, give or take a few pennies. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> True, it's nice to labour   under the misapprehension that they think we're worth that much, but in reality   I suspect they're just trying to induce urgency. They also think we care how   much the boss's budget loses, but that's another issue entirely. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Quick, change it while   it's in the print queue," the PFY shouts, seeing the 'Print' dialog appearing.   He dives for his keyboard, but stops himself as he notices my smug grin. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Sure enough, a few days   later the boss walks in, with the financial director in tow, to see how we're   doing. Just so he can be kept happy we've installed a big 'job status' screen   (103" TFT displays don't come cheap, but it had to be flat to be wall-mounted)   which is showing lots of healthy 'green' jobs. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Allow me to explain. A   'red job is a call on which we have missed our deadline. A 'green' job, on the   other hand, is a call which has been logged but not yet attended to, but whose   deadline is still in the future. We persuaded the management that we didn't   need to record completed calls, as they were largely irrelevant to progress.   True, the fact that there weren't any made it even more pointless, but we didn't   exactly press that issue. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Good show, chaps," the   financial director booms in his clipped retired-Army-lieutenant-who-still-calls-himself-colonel   tones. (Note at this point the derivation of the word 'colonel', as in COLON-el).   "Keeping ahead of things, I see!" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh yes, sir, we make a   point of hitting our targets." Yeah, but I'm not telling you what with. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The phone rings, and the   PFY flinches at the intensity of the boss's "answer it or die" look. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> He's certainly learning.   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Operations, PFY speaking."   </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The boss manages to shepherd   the financial director out of the office while he's still happy, leaving the   PFY to look after his 'customer'. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes, I realise we haven't   managed to get round to you yet, but we're very busy, and we're still within   the permitted fix time - yes, I know you called on September 8th - yes, I know   it's the 30th today. What's that? Sure, I'll just look it up - ah, here it is.   14 April 2003 seems to be the deadline. Tell you what, I'll call you on the   13th just to make sure you still work here, just so I don't waste my time coming   up to your office only to find you've fallen out of a window. No, that's not   a threat, just a vision of the future. Bye now." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The days pass and we while   away the time as our part-time assistant (drafted in for two hours a week to   cope with the vast demand being placed on our human resources) knocks off the   odd job here and there just so the board isn't too full. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Meanwhile, unrest is growing   among the users, who don't seem to realise just how hard it is to keep that   board full of green call reports. It's a full fortnight before the boss catches   on to what we're up to. It took him a while, but his training is coming along   nicely and every so often he spots what's happening. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Tell me," he prompts,   "just how many calls actually get as far as being closed?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Depends how you mean 'closed',"   I reply. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Like, problems getting   solved." </font><P><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Depends what you mean   by 'solved'." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"AAAAAGGGGHHHHHH!!" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Okay, let me explain.   We set deadlines to give ourselves enough time to do the job properly. Right?"   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Riiigggghhhhttt..." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We have two alternatives.   First, we can go and fix the problem. This takes time and draws us away from   our real job." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"And I'm not even going   to ask what you think that is. What's the other option?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We sit in the pub doing   essential network maintenance and, by the time the many-months-off deadline   arrives, the problem, or preferably the user, has gone away. The deadline generator   is tied into the HR staff turnover measurement system." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A twinkle in the boss's   eye tells me he's plotting. And he knows better than to come up with anything   that isn't grossly beneficial to my spotty colleague and myself. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> He strides off purposefully,   returning half an hour later looking triumphant. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I persuaded the financial   director that stuff might get done a little bit before deadline if there was   some incentive to our department for finishing jobs before deadline." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"How much?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Don't ask. Enough." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Within a day and a half   the call-board is darker than a gorilla's groin, and the Operations beer-fund,   which is index-linked to the boss's budget, is looking healthier than ever.   I could grow to like the idea of accountability. </font><P> <P><HR><CENTER>  <H2><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> One wager and a lager     frenzy later, the BOFH is feeling somewhat worse for wear after messing with     the teatime continuum </font></H2></CENTER><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I'm not a well man. <P> In fact, I'd go so far as to say I'm feeling poorly. <P> But having used up my sick leave entitlement during the World Cup and considering   a bomb threat too drastic, I struggle into work. After all, if you're going   to be crook, you may as well do it on company time. It always makes me feel   a little better anyway. The source of my illness was plain to see once I'd emerged   from the bed to focus on the congealed remains of a half-eaten kebab solidified   on the top of the TV set and half a pot of cold coffee sitting on the table. <P> A vague memory crosses my mind, collides with a patchy recollection and goes   down...I seem to remember a lager frenzy starting at the pub just down from   the office following the outcome of some wager that ended in my favour. As they   do. <P> A wager that must have undoubtedly involved the boss in some way, shape or   form, following his imperial command just a few days ago with regard to morning   and afternoon tea. Apparently we're only supposed to take one of each a day,   and they're only supposed to be 15 minutes long. And they're to be measured   by the company's clocks and not by any personal equipment. Talk about cruel   and unusual punishment. <P> Of course no one expected him to enforce the ruling, so it came as a little   bit of a surprise when the unauthorised timesheet prunings were brought to light   by a less-than-expected payment cheque. <P> I manage to drag myself to work, although I have to admit to feeling very   seedy by the time I get to the relative security of my office. A rest is called   for. <P> I redirect my phone to the voicemail of the networks and systems group of   the company, three buildings over, then catch up with some well-deserved sleep. <P> An hour later I'm woken by the entry of the PFY into the room. Well, more   accurately, the sound of the PFY falling through the door to Mission Control. <P> His condition is no better than my own, but I'm hoping that his memory of   events will tide me over. <P> A hope that fades quickly when he informs me that the last thing he remembers   was when we pulled the toner cartridge out of the fax machine and shorted out   the 'toner low' and 'cartridge-removed' sensors. <P> Further questioning is pointless once the PFY reveals that the next thing   he remembers is waking up in the telecomms access duct at the rear of the building. <P> Curiouser and curiouser... <P> I can only assume that some major form of celebration occurred, the likes   of which is not often seen in computing circles (i.e. as rare as a bug-free   Microsoft release). <P> CCTV is no help, revealing only that we left the building at approximately   5:22pm, considerably the worse for wear, in the company of half the secretarial   pool, who also looked like they had a bad case of bottle fatigue. <P> Being a troubleshooting professional of long standing, I apply the first rule   of problem solving by asking the question "what has changed?". Observation:   there aren't many healthy-looking staff at their desks. <P> I apply the second rule of problem-solving by tracking the problem backwards   - 5:22 is far too late for me to be working, so <P> I must have been propping up the bar at the company anti-social club. <P> I put in a call to one of the more human company lawyers, who's rostered on   to bar duty this week to see if he remembered us. <P> I eventually track him down to his cellphone. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes, you called me to   open up the bar rather early..." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"When was that then?" I   ask. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"About 10:30am." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Missing time and memory   accounted for, more important questioning must follow. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Spend much?" I ask, with   a due sense of trepidation. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"As it happened, no," he   said. "Not after you pointed out that your boss's memo distinctly states that   the company shall provide beverages, at its own expense, for all staff between   the hours of 10am and 11am." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"So what happened at 11?"   the PFY blurts over my shoulder. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"That's not come around   as yet. It's only about 10:49am at the moment. I'm not sure, but the clock appears   to be running incredibly slowly. Mine is not to reason why though.." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Yet another penny drops   and I vaguely remember tweaking the calibration knob on the pulse-advance unit   of the company's timekeeping system to buy us a longer tea-break. Perhaps a   hammer wasn't the best tool for the tweak job. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You mean it's been between   10:30 and 11 for a day?" the PFY gasps. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Ah...two days I think   you'll find." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A quick squint at the unfeasibly   small numbers on my wristwatch confirms his story. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Bloody hell. What's management   doing about it then?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well when your boss left   here about 16 hou...I mean about six minutes ago, he said he'd be back in five   minutes. The whole of legal's here still, because they were on the late morning   tea shift, and the DP pool are taking their morning tea in one-minute instalments."   </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> About 43 hours [11 minutes]   later, the PFY, myself and some hardcore legal and DP drinkers are helped out   of the building. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> By the police. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> If I've said it once, I've   said it a thousand times: "AGG AAARRICC GUBB IN FARLIN GOT!" And you can quote   me on that. </font><P> <P><HR><CENTER>  <H2><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A bluff report may fool     auditors that the company is running smoothly but try telling a hospitalised     boss why safety procedures have been ignored </font></H2></CENTER><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Something feels wrong. I know it immediately. It's a seventh sense among seasoned support professionals. <P> The PFY confirms it when he gets back from morning tea - at the pub - and   looks around as if to check everything is as it should be. <P> It's like a funny-coloured smell. <P> The boss must be up to something. We could be over-sensitive, but I think   he's a bit upset about me telling the helpdesk staff the grey powder on their   furniture might be asbestos dust. That was two days ago, but the mass walkout   and hypochondria is yet to end, despite proof that the dust concerned was in   fact talcum powder dyed grey. <P> Some form of retaliation is expected and the waiting game ends fairly shortly   when we see the boss waddling in our direction. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I think it's about time   you did some documentation," he blurts, after exhausting his list of social   niceties ("How are you?", "How are things going?" and "Isn't that memory the   stuff that's missing from my desktop machine?"). </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Documentation?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes, a site guide, configuration   standards, network and systems topologies, installed software, site customisations,"   he burbles, reeling off the sentence he's obviously spent half the morning committing   to memory at great personal risk to the other contents of his brain (where he   lives, what his name is, when it's appropriate to unzip his fly etc.). </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"But we've got all that   already - in the fireproof filing cabinet over there," I respond, pointing at   a dull grey monster in the corner that I've only ever opened once. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, let's have a look   at it." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, I'd like to, but   apparently my assistant locked the key in it the last time he was updating the   information!" I cry, using the PFY as a scapegoat for this particular excuse   (as previously arranged, of course). </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Then get a locksmith in!"   the boss yells, not one to be put off by small details. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Three hours and one fire   alarm later the 'documentation' is a mass of ashen remains in the now open cabinet.   The fact that they were a mass of ashen remains when I put them in is beside   the point. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I can't think why the   PFY would have put that large jar of tapehead cleaner right next to where the   locksmith would have to gas-axe the lock open. What an oversight!" I wail, stifling   a snigger as the boss gingerly applies some burn cream to his hands. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It's irrelevant now. I   want some documentation to show the auditors." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The auditors?" I protest.   "What do glorified beancounters want documentation for?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Not monetary auditors,   company auditors. Since the company sold itself to that US combine we have to   have our every move audited to ensure the place is a smooth-running machine."   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"My money's on a '73 Ford   Escort running on three cylinders with water in the fuel tank, but I take your   point." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"So I'll expect reprints   of your documentation first thing tomorrow," the boss says, leaving. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Auditors?" the PFY asks.   "I haven't heard anything about them." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"First thing you'd better   do is OCR scan some random manual pages - the older the better - into a word   processor to add a bit of bulk to our documentation. I'll dump the network topology   mapper output into another document in 24 point, which should use up about 100   pages by itself. Then push the DNS through a perl filter to add some fancy field   information to it. Then I'll work on some table of contents pages, etc.," I   reply. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"But won't they know it's   crap?" the PFY asks. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Nah, there'll be so much   of it they'll look at the table of contents, check the first few pages, then   randomly open the documents at certain pages. Which reminds me. Anything that's   reasonably legit should be printed on heavier paper than the rest of the document   so that anyone flipping through will stop there. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You sound like you've   done this before." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"One of the tricks of the   contracting trade.

However, bearing in mind that   the auditors have probably seen a few of these in their time, I'm going to have   to insert some believable stuff into the procedures area. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> An hour later, I've whipped   out ten good pages of bumpf on "Hot Swap," "Disaster recovery," "Host configuration   and naming," "Router configuration standards", etc. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I also chuck in some roughly   accurate palaver about cabling, trunking and patch panel locations, as well   as a brief outline of emergency service and security configuration information.   I slap it all together into an appropriately named folder, then subject it to   the ageing process (meaning I jump up and down on it, kick it around until some   of the pages fall out, then spill some food and ink on it) to make it look like   it's heavily referred to. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The document gets submitted,   and, judging by the lack of evidence to the contrary, the auditors must be happy.   </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> And so it was that the   next day the PFY and I were standing beside the network monitor when it started   emitting the telltale signs of a router not talking to anything any more. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"That'll be the boss turning   on router redundant takeover." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"How can you be sure?"   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The old ROMS don't support   it - it causes a memory leak. Of course, I forgot to document that.

No, no, it wasn't a product-dumping   exercise at all. Just coincidence.<P> Oh, and a complete change of architecture... <P> So we see the new model, with a new bus (which means that stockpile of peripheral   cards you bought are about as in demand as XT thin-wire cards), 20 per cent   increase in processor speed, 80 per cent increase in cost, 200 per cent increase   in size and ugliness of logo, and immediately the braindead among the audience   start drooling. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"As you'll see," our presenter   says with a coat-hanger grin, "the SpecWPIOP Int figures for our machine are   much higher than for any other manufacturer's machine of comparable price..."</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Ah," I interject, suppressing   with great effort my sense of annoyance at their transparency, "could that be   because you just made up the SpecWPIOP Int standard to take advantage of your   new kit's design?"</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Certainly not," our presenter   hotly denies, "the SpecWPIOP Int is an open industry standard!"</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"And who," I ask, knowing   full well the answer, "developed and opened this standard?"</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well I have to admit,   somewhat proudly, that our company has excelled in developing a standard which   truly reflects the loads on an active system of varying users more accurately   than something which performs simple integer test cases."</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"In other words, you made   it up?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No No! Bookmarking figures   have, for some time, not taken into account the true loads on a system which   may have users of varying types, from development, to database, to data entry.   The SpecWPIOP takes into account all these things to produce a figure that is   fully representative of the 'whole-system', or 'holistic-interoperative' approach,   as we like to call it." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I look around me and notice   that the guy's got about 60 per cent of the customers sold, with their proverbial   pants already at half mast.</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"So SpecWPIOP, what does   that stand for?" I ask.</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Specifications When Pmmmmmdmd   Idndn Ouidud Pddnls," he mumbles. "Pardon?"</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Specifications When Plugged   Into Our Peripherals," he murmurs slyly.</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh! So what you're saying   is that when you plug one of your SCSI disks, say, into another manufacturer's   hardware, the processor is so busy dealing with the errors generated by your   non-standard interface that it works much slower."</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"That's not it at all,"   he gasps, incredulous. "Why, just looking at the system in action would convince   anyone otherwise!!!"</font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> He proceeds to power the   thing up and it whirrs into life with an impressive start-up sound.</font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Worth at least half of   the purchase price alone, when combined with the new full-colour start-up graphic!!!</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"And if I could get a volunteer   from the aud..."</font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I almost pop a hamstring   in my hurry to be first out the gate and up to the podium. I can tell that I   wasn't the volunteer that he was looking for - probably having primed some Infomercial   dropout with questions to ask and 'Gosh, look at that!' responses to give.</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Ah," he murmurs, not wishing   to let me near his kit, but not really having much choice in the matter. "How   about you start up the Graphical User Interface by clicking on the little screen   icon then?"</font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I do so and am actually   very impressed with the speed of the start-up.

I've surreptitiously flicked a small handful of   aluminium foil underneath the machine...into the thirsty holes of the cooling-inlet.   </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The subsequent short-circuiting,   smoke and minor explosion rounded off the entertainment for the afternoon -   ruining the new business prospects for the manufacturer and sending the presenter   home with a 'shocking' new hairstyle - after he regained consciousness. Suffice   to say that the rest is history - the model isn't being pulled from the market   per se - another demonstration is being organised in a month from now when they   iron out the "power supply problems", but at least it's restored, temporarily   at least, the resale price of my peripherals to give me a chance to offload   them on some poor, unsuspecting alternate customer of our vendor.</font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Ah well, you know what   they say - all's fair in love and hardware acquisition...</font><P> <P><HR><CENTER>  <H2><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> You won't believe what's     been going on the Boss's credit card...and it's not just the BOFH who thinks     that'll do nicely - he's got a new flexible friend... </font></H2></CENTER><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I'm scanning through the swathes of my early morning e-mail, culling out all the spam messages about credit cards, free home loans, career opportunities and new, improved sex sites. <P> Propagating our Web cache with smut apparently destined for the Boss is a   sure-fire way to get immunity from a bollocking if you're caught browsing at   it yourself during work time, and it solves the hassle of having to wait for   the stuff to load over the smut site's crappy Ethernet connection. <P> True, loading the Boss's corporate credit card details into the robot was   a little on the nose, but it all boils down to what you're willing to pay for   a good cache service. <P> And the Boss sure is paying - I've had to have his credit card limit extended   twice this month just to keep up with the volume of incoming material the patient   and inquisitive robot has found. <P> If he didn't want to buy anything with his credit card, he wouldn't have got   one in the first place. Nor would he have left it carelessly lying around in   a sealed envelope, locked in his briefcase, secured inside that filing cabinet   drawer marked 'IT94 conference proceedings', in the cleaners' cupboard at the   far end of the building. He was just asking for it to be used. <P> However, I'm pleased to say that the cache is responding well to the challenge   now that I've whacked those two new nine gig drives into the server.

I respond, upset   that my little smut-acquiring goldmine looks like meeting its end. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh that'll just be DHCP   mapping playing up again," the PFY jumps in. "It's just because our DNS isn't   dynamic, so it's charged against your machine, but really is some other machine   using the IP address you were using when the IP usage stats program was run!"   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Duh - really?" the Boss   responds, so far out of his technical depth he's looking for a life raft and   water wings. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yeah, it's nothing to   worry about." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh," the Boss says, happy   in the knowledge that his desktop is faithful to him only. "So who is generating   the IP traffic then?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Ah...that'll probably   be our site's Web server," I jump in. </font><P><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"But I thought you told   me last week that servers weren't going to use DHCP?" the Boss quips, annoying   me with an unexpected attack of accurate recall. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No, no, I said that surfers   don't use DHCP - because...ah...most of them don't even have PCs...and those   who do don't take them to the beach anyway..." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What have surfers got   to do with our company?" the Boss blurts, even more confused than normally...   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Nothing that I know of,"   I respond. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"So why did you tell me   about it?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Just passing the time   of day..." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Our conversation is interrupted   by the arrival of a beancounter wearing a worried expression, which can only   mean that the credit card eagle has landed. Crash landed by the sour look on   his face. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It's about your company   credit card," he mumbles anxiously. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What about it?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It's 23,000 in the red!"   </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I'm a bit shocked at this   figure, as I only cranked the card limit up to 10k, but put it down to a credit   card company keen to generate revenue... </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"That's preposterous,"   the Boss blurts. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It's all here in black   and white - but mostly red," the beancounter says, handing over some papers.   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What's this www.spank-spank.org...and   too-tight-lederhosen.com? And who the hell is the Progressive Press in Amsterdam?"   </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A warning bell rings in   my head as I don't recall any Web-site by that name. I grab the papers from   the beancounter and find that Web traffic accounts for only about 10 per cent   of the charges therein, the rest appearing to be for merchandise shipped into   the UK... </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I have no idea," the beancounter   responds. "But it's all above board on your card..." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It can't be, my card's   locked away safely, in a drawer in a cabling cupboard." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"A cleaning cupboard, I   think you'll find," I mention, cheerfully. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"And in a filing cabinet,"   the PFY adds. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Sealed in an envelope,   in a briefcase," the beancounter finishes smugly, much to the surprise of the   PFY and I. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> So it seems there's a new   player in the game - a beancounter gone bad. Excellent. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The Boss burbles some crap   about us not getting away with it, and rushes off to get his card cancelled.   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The horse has bolted on   that one," the beancounter chirps happily. "Besides, I used his old card as   leverage for a new one with a different bank." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"And...?" I ask, preparing   for war. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I sent the Boss's details   in e-mail. Not encrypted with his public key of course, yours in fact - what   an oversight!" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"So what you're saying   is the Boss has an e-mail message he can't read..." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"That anyone with your   private key intercepting that e-mail could..." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It's a wet and windy afternoon   when the crack security force of the building break into the Boss's office and   drag him up to the board for a good spanking. Apparently his claims of innocence   fell upon deaf ears when enquiries revealed that the shipping address for the   'progressive' media was the Boss's summer house... </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> One down, too many more   to go. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> But at least we have an   ally in the enemy camp... </font><P> <P><HR><CENTER>  <H2><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The eye on the wall     has seen all, so it's time for desperate measures to cover up the half measures     of sherry left in the boardroom decanters... </font></H2></CENTER><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Sooner or later, it was bound to happen. We know it, we prepare for it, but it still comes as a proverbial kick in the goolies. <P> Security wants its systems back. Well, actually not Security at all - we have   a great working relationship - but its new manager - an ex-military type who   takes the job far too seriously. He (outrageously) believes CCTV security systems   should be Security's responsibility, and that Network and Systems Operations   types shouldn't have unrestricted swipe card access to the building "to enable   rapid support". <P> In other words, he's trying to make us join the great unwashed. <P> Our new boss is no bloody help. With the spine of a jellyfish, he backed down   in record time. <P> I don't like it. <P> The PFY doesn't like it. <P> Something's got to give. <P> And give it does. The final straw comes when the new boss pops into the office   and asks what we were doing in the boardroom last night at 6.35pm. <P> Obviously the answer "Drinking ourselves senseless with a couple of members   of the secretarial pool" - is out of the question. <P> So it looks like I'm going to have to ad-lib. And we're not talking sound   cards here. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Ahh...checking the connectivity   of the individual ISDN desktop ports," I blurt quickly. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Really? It doesn't look   like that!" he cries, brandishing a frame-grabbed image from CCTV showing the   PFY topping up a half-full sherry decanter with a reconstituted version of the   original. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"That's disgusting!" I   cry heatedly. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes it is," the boss concurs,   saddling up his high horse for the 11.30 hurdles. "As is this," he continues,   flashing another image - of me this time - making up the PFY's shortfall (he's   just young). </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"And what do you have to   say about that?" he challenges. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, obviously I need   to reduce my vitamin B intake," I cry. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I'm only joking. It's   obviously a fake." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, if it's a fake,"   he responds smugly, holding up a strangely familiar vessel, "you won't mind   taking a quick swig of this." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Not at all," I respond,   pouring myself a healthy dram, or 57, and downing it in record time. "As I said,   it's a fake - a plan by security to discredit us with misinformation. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Obviously a video edit.   Look at the pixellation around the thing. It's been digitised and re-enhanced."   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I...uh..." the boss mumbles,   inquisition in ashes. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> After he's slouched out   in despair (not having the bottle, or even a decanter) to face up to the head   of Security, the PFY comes over. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Can't believe you bloody   drank that," he gasps disgustedly. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Ah, don't be silly - I   put the full one at the back and swapped the seal with that one. The board's   stupid, but not stupid enough to mistake that for sherry. Not until they've   had a couple of priming decanters anyway." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A swivel from the camera   behind the computer room viewing window alerts me to a potential problem. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Reckon he can read lips?"   I ask the PFY from behind my coffee cup. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It's possible," the PFY   comments, apparently yawning. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Right. Emergency action   is called for!" </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The PFY and I race up the   staircase to the boardroom to dispose of the evidence. But we are too late.   The head of Security is already in the room and has hurled glassware everywhere   in his haste to find the decanter at the back. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> With any luck...but no   - the sole surviving decanter is much, much clearer than the one I drank from.   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We're stuffed," the PFY   whispers. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Not quite," I blurt, remembering   the access card system's configuration parameters. I swipe my card through the   reader, then punch in an incorrect PIN number. And again. And again. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The fourth attempt triggers   an alarm, and the Security boss rushes over to the door to swipe the door release   from his side...but too late. The ten-minute lockout has occurred. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Quick as a flash the PFY   pulls the phone and network connections from the room, then manually locks the   access corridor to the boardroom. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Hang on, he'll break the   emergency release glass," the PFY cries. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"He would. If I hadn't   replaced it with the bulletproof stuff years ago." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> We pull a couple of chairs   up and wait for the inevitable, swiping the door invalidly every nine minutes   or so to keep the lockout in force. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> To his credit, the head   of Security held out well - the military influence no doubt. It takes nearly   ten hours for thirst to set in. And a full two more before he unstoppers the   bottle. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I'd have tipped it on   the ground," the PFY says quietly, at the pub a day later. "That would have   solved it." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yeah, there's no understanding   the military mind," I sigh, as I contemplate the names he's going to be called   by his troops, who were too busy making video dubs of the proceedings to come   to his aid - even if they'd wanted to. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Different horses for different   courses...</font><P> <P><HR><CENTER>  <H2><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A fellow bastard in     Wales who doesn't have cable TV turns out to be the ideal excuse for procuring     some extra bandwidth </font></H2></CENTER><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I'm tunnelling a few episodes of an extra- terrestrial TV drama series down the Internet because a good-bastard acquaintance of mine in Wales (OK, a poor-bastard acquaintance as well) hasn't seen them all and wants to get up to speed before he rents the movie. <P> As a result of the (albeit compressed) video and audio stream, our connection   to the rest of the world isn't performing up to what we laughingly refer to   as scratch. <P> And there's NO POINT in getting into a discussion with the new boss about   bandwidth requirements, as he's been trawling through the notes of his various   predecessors (including the ones in crayon from the loony academy saying "THEY'RE   OUT TO GET ME!") and has already informed me that there IS no upgrade path... <P> However, this doesn't solve the perceivable lack of response of transmission,   but with any luck it'll pick up once I patch the video onto a live redundant   bearer that our network carrier company ran to our building but neglected to   configure as 'down'. <P> I mean, that's just GAGGING for it, as all of their competitors wouldn't have   left a spare NTU in the building in the first place. <P> Of course, I justify the temporary unofficial upgrade by telling myself how   much the carrier company is screwing us for. Who says I'm not the sentimental   type? <P> I liven up the link and run a test. Sure enough, it's even on an active router   port! I route the video through it, thanking the gods for a provider with more   ports and money than sense... <P> It's just a matter of time of course, so I make sure that external caller-ID   and subscriber look-up are configured into the phone. Sure enough, in a couple   of hours, I get a call from our network carrier's customer rep. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Hello, Belgian Steak and   Waffle House...do you need a reservation?" I say carefully, in an accent somewhere   between eastern Europe and East London. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Sorry, wrong number,"   the caller mutters, then rings off. Two seconds later, he's back. "Belgian Steak   and Waffle House...do you need a reservation?" </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Now he's confused. He verifies   the number he has in front of him against mine, then asks if we have computers   on the premises. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I theenk you mean the   peepill upstairs," I say.

I blurt to   the PFY, as soon as he rolls in, holding one of the aforementioned posters.   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Why?" he asks, with the   air of someone seriously contemplating taking up the offer. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh, puhleeze.

"But..." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"But?"

I finish. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yeah.

After I'd installed the software on his brand spanking new laptop, I slapped a "Warranty void if seal broken" sticker across the front of it.<P> The beads of sweat on his brow and twitching fingers - as he contemplates   getting his hands on the thing - speak volumes about his state of mind. He's   obviously in Minesweeper withdrawal - even though I replaced the version on   his old laptop with one that always explodes a bomb in the first move.<P> I leave him to his personal trauma.<P> Sure enough, he's cracked under the pressure, and enters my office 15 minutes   later.</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"That bloody laptop doesn't   work!" he bellows.</font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It's not surprising considering   the PFY and I gutted all but the keyboard, power supply and screen to provide   the heart and soul for our latest and greatest project, the IT cleaning droid   - which is infinitely more intelligent than the floor polishing droids they   release into the corridors at night. I wrote the code myself, even the image   recognition and seek-and-destroy - I mean seek-and-clean - code. It's a work   of art.</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What happened?" I ask.</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, I opened it up an..."</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You opened it up?!"</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes."</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"And voided the warranty?!"</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I couldn't use it 'til   I'd opened it up, could I? The keyboard's inside when it's closed."</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh, I see what you mean.   I thought you'd broken one of those warranty void seals!" I cry, faking the   kind of relief some people pay large sums of money for.</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Ah, well, there was one   seal I had to break, but that was the one over the 'open' latch."</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You mean you didn't get   an engineer to install it?!" I gasp.</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You installed it!"</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No, I only put the software   on it via Target-Mode SCSI upload. You need an engineer to provide the inherent   firmware personality modes." (Dummy mode on.)</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"But it's a bloody laptop,   not a mainframe," he sniffles.</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes, but the engineer   has to set the localisation on the machine for you, and personalise the unit,   passwords and stuff."</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I see. Well, you'd best   do it."</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You're joking aren't you?   They're not going to touch it with a broken warranty void sticker."</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Why not?"</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Because you could have   set the localisation to Peru, or something. That'll all have been stored in   permanent non-volatile, doubly redundant, device-specific, static RAM." (Dummy   mode cranked up.)</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What does that mean?"</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It means all the components   have stored the fact that your machine is installed in Peru, Antarctica, or   wherever it configured itself for.

But it'd   never be under warranty."</font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Quicker than you can whisper   "executive decision" down a scrambled phone line, the boss has agreed to purchase   the aforementioned items.</font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I, of course, slap all   the old stuff back into the boss's machine - being sure to leave a couple of   scratches on the casing and have a couple of screws left over so that it looks   like a real engineer worked on it - then kick it into life (literally) and hand   it back to the boss.</font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> So everyone's happy. The   boss has his new laptop, and the droid has brand spanking new hardware. I fire   up the droid and get the PFY on the remote console to give my code a good, hard   seeing-to.

At AA meetings, anyway.</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No, it has an object back-up   of a foot so people don't walk into it."</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Meaning?"</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Meaning it backs up a   foot from any object."</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I see," he says, "and   what about moving objects?"</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It keeps a foot away from   them," I respond, anticipating his plan. "So you're not going to run it into   a wall at top speed, nor is it going to let you run up to it and 'physically   reboot' it the old-fashioned way."</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The thought never entered   my head," the PFY replies, offended. "I was just wondering what it would do   in this situation," he says, pointing at the video monitor showing the boss   entering the lift with his new laptop.</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"So you've not heard of   a lag to prevent hysteresis?" the PFY burbles smugly (and drunkenly) at the   pub later that evening.</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Uh-huh," I mumble, "where   are we up to now?"</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Ah, I think we're up to   where the droid backed up from the lift wall and into the boss, then backed   up from the boss, over his laptop and into the lift wall.

I respond politely,   while reaching under the table for the 2-wood golf club which I keep for special   occasions.</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes, yes, but I'm not   sure it's valid," he blurts, trying to hide himself deep in the rough.</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Really?" I ask, foregoing   the 2-wood for a 6-iron, considering the lie of the conversation.</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Errm, no. You see, he's   complained about your music."</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What music?" the PFY asks.   "That music," he replies, indicating the surrounding air.</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"That music?" I ask, waving   a hand around in a similar manner while reconsidering my options.</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes, he's complaining   that it's too loud."</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Too loud?" the PFY counters   disgustedly. "But we can hardly hear it."</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I use it for relaxation,"   I murmur. "It keeps me calm in the face of adversity."</font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Now that the implied threat   is on the table, there's nothing left for the boss to do but back down. Or risk   life and limb in the pursuit of an unattainable goal.</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I know that you can hardly   hear it, but the same doesn't go for the people downstairs. Anyway, I can't   believe that it's relaxing."</font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> So it's life and limb on   the line then.</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Offspring is a very relaxing   band," I say. "Yeah, it's the comforting bass line," the PFY chirps. "Besides,"   I add, "it's at a low level." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"NOT IN THE BLOODY COMPUTER   ROOM IT ISN'T!" the boss shouts, losing patience.</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, no, but if we turned   it down we wouldn't be able to hear it through the soundproof wall." "The people   on the floor below bloody well can, though! Why don't you put your stereo in   here?"</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We tried that, but it   kept popping the circuit breaker when we turned the volume past 3."</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"THEN GET A NORMAL STEREO!"</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It IS a normal stereo,"   I gasp.</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"NORMAL?"</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes, Notting Hill Carnival   normal."</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well it's not good enough.   </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I want it TURNED DOWN!"</font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> This just won't do. The   PFY and I are relying on the 'comforting bass line' to work its magic on a rack   of disks that should have been retired, but for the stupidity of management   who want both zero downtime and reliable service.</font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> So it's back to the drawing   board again. I slap a set of airport-issue ear protectors on, having learnt   from the PFY's mistakes (the poor bastard set off the water leak detector circuits   when he wet his pants after pressing the 'play' button with the volume set at   6).</font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Entering the computer room,   I notice the error of his ways - he'd left the volume at 6 when he stepped in   his own by-products AND he hadn't switched the bass expand circuits on.</font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I note that the amp's power   supply is 'running a little hot', as we in the trade say. Not good. I break   off the volume knob (now pointing at the infamous '11' setting, then slip back   into the control room, just in time to see a wild-eyed boss burst through the   door.</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I TOLD YOU TO TURN IT   DOWN, NOT UP!"</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I tried to turn it down,"   I blurt, "but the knob broke off!"</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Why didn't you turn it   off then?!"</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Because the amp was so   warm I thought it might trigger the heat sensors and release the halon."</font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> So, of course, he is screwed.   He KNOWS this is a 'tragic workplace accident' with his name scribbled all over   it, and he's not going to bite.</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well can't you switch   the power off from the breakers outside?" he asks.</font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> What a wimp. "We can try!"   I cry, rushing to the breaker cupboard. "All the ceiling outlets in the front   are on red phase, so it's got to be one of these."</font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 30 seconds later..."Red?   </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I thought they were blue,"   the PFY chips in.</font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A further 30 seconds later..."So,   it's yellow then," the boss cries, in the face of a cacophony of outage alarms.</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Worth a crack!" I cry,   flipping a switch.</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No, that's the old disk   rack," the PFY cries from the observation window.</font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> CLACK! "Disk rack again!"</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"My mistake!" I blurt,   innocently, then flip the next switch.</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Right, let's see what   the damage is," the boss cries, pushing past me to the computer room.</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I wouldn't..." I cry,   but too late.</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You see the problem with   kit like that," I explain to the PFY at the window, "is that turning off the   power also shuts off the cooling fan, whereas switching it off at its power   switch will leave the fan on until the unit has finished cooling."</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"So the kit gets hotter?"</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Let's see what the judges   have to say," I respond, nodding at one of the heat sensors.</font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A couple of short, and   fairly muffled 'whoop-whoops' later...</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Is the halon hold-off   button still broken?" the PFY asks.</font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, the judges' decision   on that one is...final, by the looks of things. Still time for a quick wave   though," I cry.</font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Of course, we let him out...   eventually. After all, he's only new. </font><P> <P><HR><CENTER>  <H2><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Someone has lifted some     kit from under the BOFH's nose. Is it the boss? Is it the beancounters? No.     There's a new Bastard in town. </font></H2></CENTER><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I was mystified. The boss was giving me grief for missing kit, which was nothing unusual but this time I hadn't prepared my story. The simple reason was that it wasn't me who'd taken it. And this time it was a serious amount of kit that had gone. <P> Naturally, it's taken as read that a certain amount of spillage finds its   way to BOFH Enterprises but very little actually disappears - the value tends   to appear as miscellaneous lines in a beancounter's spreadsheet and besides,   not much of this Unattributed Cost (as I believe the technical term is) finds   its way into my pocket - mainly because it generally goes towards paying for   a small holiday in Acapulco or somewhere equally humble. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It's strange," I say to   the PFY after we'd escaped from the boss's sanctum, our ears still ringing from   the force of his invective. "It's strange that whoever is doing this has evaded   all our carefully prepared traps (the electrified door handle and the strategically   placed axe) and has managed to liberate some of our shiny new stock. He wasn't   even put off by its careful labelling as 'defective'." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> There were three possibilities:   we'd had a break-in by a thief who knew exactly what he was looking for; the   boss had woken up to the possibility that there was serious remuneration in   'defective' stock; or there was another Bastard somewhere on the premises. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I discounted the first   possibility. Not only had none of our alarms gone off but an outside tea-leaf   would surely have taken the colour TV (sorry, the High-Definition Multimedia   Receiving Apparatus) that the PFY and I use during downtime or when the Test   Match is on (which seem to coincide with remarkable regularity). </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Could it be the boss?"   asks the PFY. "Do you think that the bollocking he's just given us was all for   show?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Impossible. The boss is   not just dim, he's 20 watt. I understand that he needs an A-Z to find his way   home at night." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"And even then he gets   lost," says the PFY, alluding to the night that the boss foolishly came for   a drink with the boys, only to discover that extra-strength Polish white spirit   is undetectable in strong lager (and after three of them so is shoe polish).   "Still, it was only a 30 taxi ride from the wilds of east London." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> That, incredible as it   seemed, left only the possibility of one of my fellow workers, a breed for whom   technical sophistication means changing the text colour in Office. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> But which one? It was obviously   no one in marketing - they scarcely had the intelligence to turn a door handle   the right way. It was obviously not anyone in sales as they'd hardly be elsewhere   while the pubs were open and not sober enough after they'd closed. The beancounters   were a strong possibility - those Unattributed Costs were really getting under   their skin - but they'd have chosen a more subtle revenge. It couldn't have   been anyone from admin and building services... </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Something clicked. There   was a new guy there who a few weeks before had gone round asking questions,   "just to test the security of the building". Naturally I hadn't given him the   right answers but how could I have been so stupid... </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Now I come to think about   it, this guy seemed to be a cut above the rest but then so would an orang-utan.   The only question was how to get the kit back, or, failing that, a contribution   to the Bastard Holiday Fund. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Seeking inspiration, I   idly flicked through the outgoing post log. One foreign-bound item caught my   eye and I smiled. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The next day, I went down   to building services and happened to overhear Kevin talking. By chance, he was   dropping some big words like 'screen' and 'keyboard' so I knew we had our man.   It was time for a phone call. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Back at mission control,   I flicked on the intercom and heard Kevin's voice come over loud and clear,   as a deep foreign voice said: "Mr Kevin?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yeah, who's this?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Just call me Stefan. It's   about this consignment of tights that you delivered to us." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"That's right, you got   'em?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We have, that's just the   point. I was given to understand that...er, certain other goods were being delivered."   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"But...but..." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I hope you realise that   the last person who double-crossed us is now part of a motorway infrastructure."   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"But...but..." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I'm sure you want to avoid   any misunderstandings. So, if you return the sum we gave you plus, say, 500   for incidental expenses, we can avoid any unfortunate repercussions. Shall we   say that you deposit the money behind the dustbin shed by 12pm today?" </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> There was a strangled "yes".   </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I switched the intercom   off. "Your cousin's very good isn't he? I said to the PFY. "I'm sure he'll go   a long way in drama college." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Come on," he replied.   "There's time for a quick game of Doom before we collect our winnings, er...   Unattributed Costs." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It takes a bastard to catch   a bastard. </font><P> <P><HR><CENTER>  <H2><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> When the BOFH bugged     the boss's office he wasn't to know the kit he'd installed would double up     as a vehicle to crack the head beancounter's nut </font></H2></CENTER><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The PFY and I are in the office teasing users by toggling their switch ports whenever their pop-client opens a connection to the mail server when an urgent alarm starts ringing on the network monitor. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"BSD?" the PFY murmurs,   "What the hell does BSD stand for?" Double-clicking on the icon concerned, he   continues: "It's in the boss's office." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Sensing my suppressed panic,   he returns to his original tack. "So what the hell's a BSD?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It's a new tailor-made   piece of kit I conceived and installed," I reply. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It's a network device,   then?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes, in that it delivers   an SNMP trap in response to certain predetermined criteria occurring." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Criteria no doubt linked   with its cryptic acronym?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Precisely." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"An acronym that stands   for?" the PFY sighs, losing patience. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Bullshit detection." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Bullshit detection?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yeah, bullshit detection.   I've decided that I can't be arsed spending a couple of hours a day sifting   through the Boss's office conversation tapes just to see if he's planning something,   so I've developed a piece of hardware and software to do it for me." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Which is?" the PFY asks,   his curiosity peaking. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Ah, a bit of voice recognition   software that parses conversations for keywords used in close proximity to each   other." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Keywords, like what?"   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"'Purchase', 'buy' or 'invest   in' - in conjunction with 'new technology', 'updated software' etc., plus lots   of other little bits and pieces that can only mean trouble." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You mean words like 'maintenance   budget'?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The very same. There's   no legitimate reason why the boss should be talking about that unless he's going   to increase it, and that's unlikely to happen following my efforts yesterday   to migrate those beancounters from that archaic tower subsystem they use for   hot back-ups." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Your efforts to migrate   users ... Oh, you mean when you set the machine on fire and pushed it out of   the third-floor window?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I most certainly did not   set the machine on fire! That was spontaneous hardware combustion - just like   the human kind the tabloids talk about. Besides, throwing it out the window   was the safest thing to do given that there was no fire extinguisher at hand."   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"There wasn't one three   floors below either, was there?" the PFY asks snidely. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I don't suppose there   was, but I can't see what that..." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"When the chunky, burning   machine plunged through the open sun-roof of the head beancounter's vehicle,   which just happened to be parked there - setting it on fire." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Coincidence, pure and   simple." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Coincidence?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes, and I resent ...   actually, is there a point to all this?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No, no," the PFY counters   innocently. "Just asking. So, this bullshit detection, what's it running on?   Not a piece of kit that the boss is going to discover - or discover missing   from where it should be?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, that's the beauty   of it. Because he's got so many machines in his office, he had a ventilation   fan installed, which just so happens to be the cooling that other tower machine   users have already been migrated from." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Not that monstrous chunk   of iron from the sixth floor that you said was using parts from Chernobyl and   expelling dangerous levels of radioactive waste?!" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The very same." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I never thought they'd   buy that." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, not at first," I   sigh, "But once I'd taken that black marker to the chest X-rays in the med centre   they couldn't wait to get rid of it" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"True," the PFY grudgingly   admits. "So, how'd you get it into the ceiling?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, Janitor George gave   me a hand lifting it into the roof as he wanted the real fan for his bathroom   at home." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"A fair exchange," the   PFY says. "So, what's the warning mean?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, it's a simple traffic   threshold MIB: the more bullshit in the office, the more network traffic the   machine reports. That way, no-one will give it a second thought." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"So what's it up to? What's   the machine's owner name field say?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"100 per cent, and Dave   C. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"So, that means Dave C   is in the boss's office talking up a storm about hardware that we should be   buying, money that he should be spending etc.." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"He's a borderline DIY   geek, isn't he?" the PFY asks warily. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Correct. Rumour has it   he installed his own keyboard once, but you know how users talk." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"But is it bad?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Oh, yes," I respond, leaning   past him to point at the display. "See the 30-second average level? That's really   the boss's level of disagreement." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"But it's at zero!" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Meaning?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"He's going to let Dave   spend our budget." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> We both break for the door   at the same time to steer the boss away from the foolish. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> But before we can get into   place the God of Computing acts. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Later, the PFY and I piece   together what had happened. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"So, apparently, Dave tried   to fix the noisy aircon fan by prodding the roofing tile with the boss's umbrella,   upsetting the BSD machine's delicate balance on the rafter and causing it to   plummet through the roof and strike the DIY cowboy," the PFY finishes. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Now that's justice for   you. </font><P><HR><H2>  <CENTER>    <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Web-only Episode: Christmas     Eve, 1998</font>  </CENTER></H2><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> He was dead all right. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You've gone too far this   time" said the PFY breathlessly. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, I guess I just under-estimated   the amount of power going through the doorknob." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It was Christmas Eve and   the seasonal prank had just gone slightly wrong. Honestly, Old Ebenezer Bastard   had tried the old "electrified door handle for the computer room" trick a dozen   times before and it had all been good seasonal fun. Still, this wasn't the first   manager to die on him and it was sure not to be the last. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Ebenezer must have stayed   a bit longer than usual in the pub that evening - this kind of event does tend   to shock you a bit and he needed a few to steady the nerves. Of course, the   fact that the young beancounter felt 'obliged' to buy him drinks all evening   helped - and all because Ebenezer had happened to mention something about video   footage from the office party. So corny, but so effective. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Anyway, the drink must   have been sitting heavily on his stomach when he got back to his flat, as he   could have sworn that the door knocker changed shape to look like the face of   his old boss (before the scorch marks disfigured it, that is). </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Putting the effects down   to the ten extra pints of Brainfrazzle he'd had, he ignored the door knocker   and went up the stairs. But there was a restlessness about him that night. In   truth, it had been a long time since he'd enjoyed Christmas. He hated all the   false bonhomie and the pleasant chit-chat from people with whom he hadn't anything   in common; he hated the way that people spent vast sums on their kids when that   money could have been quite easily diverted into the Bastard Holiday Fund. What   was worse, some of his work colleagues expected him to buy drinks for them.   </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Even young Cratchit, his   PFY, had been affected and was spending his days wistfully dreaming about Denise   from the pool and a few quick snogs under the mistletoe. The young fool even   wanted him to join him for a few drinks on Christmas Day. What did he have to   celebrate, on his salary. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Bah, humbug." Ebenezer   said loudly to himself, as he heated up the instant dinner that would represent   his one solid meal that day. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> As he went to bed in that   sparsely furnished, unheated room that he called home he saw something in the   corner: this time there was no mistaking it. It was definitely the shape of   his erstwhile Boss but there was a horrible, clanking noise that seemed to fill   the room and make Ebenezer shrink with terror. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Ebenezer Bastard" came   the voice, and though it was recognisably his boss's there was a touch of the   underworld about it. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Ebenezer Bastard" repeated   the voice. "I have been condemned to a terrible place, where men of unspeakable   wickedness live out their days. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Ebenezer breathed a sigh   of relief. "So you're not dead after all, you've just gone to work for Microsoft.   I wonder..." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Silence" thundered the   apparition and the clanking got louder. "I speak of a place where you surely   will be condemned for eternal torment." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What do you want with   me, spirit?" stammered Ebenezer, finding that the effect of ten pints of extra-strong   lager was diminishing somewhat. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"This night you will be   visited by three spirits: the Ghost of Tech Support Past; the Ghost of Tech   Support Present; and the ghost of Tech Support Yet to Come. Listen to them -   there is time yet to repent." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Spirit," said Ebenezer.   "What is that rattling sound I keep hearing?." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You mean this?" said the   shade, shaking what appeared to be long tail. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Ebenezer Bastard peered   through the gloom. He could dimly perceive a chain but tied to it were all manner   of devices that had made his life easier: there was the claw hammer that was   such an excellent "reconfiguring" tool, there was the anvil that he'd enthusiastically   "tested" PCs on, there were power staplers galore, there was every item under   the sun that had made his life easier. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I see you recognise some   of them" said the apparition with a grimace. "I used all these tools when I   was a young bastard. Now my crimes have caught up with me and I must drag my   tools around with me for eternity. But be warned, this chain is long and the   burden is onerous but the chain that is being forged for you is already twice   the length and three times as heavy." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In emphasis he shook the   chain until all the objects leaped up and down and the whole room seemed to   rattle. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I must depart now but   remember, three spirits..." and with a low moan he disappeared. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Ebenezer's courage returned.   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Bah humbug, ghosts indeed.   That beer must have been stronger than I thought". </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> And with that thought he   staggered off to bed and fell asleep without undressing. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It was just after midnight   when he awoke and peered into the gloom. What appeared to be a small child was   hovering at the foot of the bed. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Suddenly, the moon moved   from behind the clouds and Ebenezer could see that it was no child but an old   man of child's shape, dressed in what appeared to be a white tunic. As his eyes   got used to the gloom, he discerned that it was an old freebie T-shirt with   CP/M emblazoned on the front. The apparition's legs and feet were bare but round   his middle was tied some thin Ethernet cable. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Are you the Ghost of Tech   Support Past?" asked Ebenezer. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I am," said the spirit.   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Long past?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No, your past." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The ghost waved his hand   and suddenly the walls of the flat disappeared. Ebenezer and the spirit found   themselves in a busy office, where a Christmas party was in full swing. The   disco was booming out, sales people were chasing secretaries with bunches of   mistletoe, the chief bean counter was slumped in a corner, the marketing manager   was regaling the HR manager with the tales of the last campaign before last.   The air was filled with the sound of laughter, shouting, chatter, breaking glass   and a thumping disco beat: in short, a typical office party. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It's fun isn't it," said   the spirit, "but isn't there one person not joining in?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"There is," said Ebenezer.   </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Down in the bowels of the   building a solitary person was still in the computer room. Methodically working   through the personnel records of the entire staff (the HR password having long   been discovered), the young Ebenezer was ensuring that his Christmas overtime   was not being wasted. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Were you not invited to   the party?" asked the spirit. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No," said Ebenezer. "Not   since the year when the fire alarm accidentally went and the sprinklers all   came on. And of course, all the booze disappeared. For some reason they seemed   to think it was my fault, just because I'd been seen with the alarm system technical   manual that day. Miserable ingrates, after all I'd done for them." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Suddenly the vision vanished   and Ebenezer found himself back in his flat again, his mind still filled with   the wonder of what he'd seen. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> He heard a noise from another   room and peered round the corner. The room was filled with light and on a pile   of PCs sat a jolly looking gentleman. His copious stomach seemed to fill half   the room and his beard - for he appeared to be more beard than face - filled   the other half. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Are you the Ghost of Tech   Support Present?" said Ebenezer. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The spirit laughed his   assent. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Take my hand," he said,   "and let us look at the rest of the world this Christmas." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Suddenly, they were hovering   over the City. Time and time again they appeared outside computer support rooms   where teams of workers toiled diligently to solve problems as soon as they appeared.   They worked with smiles on their faces, singing along to the boom boxes parked   in the corner of their rooms. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> At Megabank there was a   particular tricky problem. "That's an easy one to solve," thought Ebenezer,   "pull the mains switch and just say that there's a network outage. And because   it's Christmas it can't be put right for a couple of days... and you still earn   the Christmas bonus." </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Instead he watched open-mouthed   as his counterpart punched in the password and worked systematically trying   to sort out the problem. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Standards are slipping,"   he thought. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> But suddenly, the scene   changed. They were in a pub and his PFY was just buying a round of drinks. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Here's to Christmas,"   he said to Denise, cheerfully raising his glass. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"And to us," she giggled.   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"And to absent friends,"   said the PFY. "Here's to old Ebenezer." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What, that old misery   guts," said Denise. "I've never known someone hate the world so much. I wish   he'd leave the company, why can't they get rid of him - no-one can stand him?"   </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Well, he knows too much   about what people have been up to. I certainly don't think the chairman wants   all the details of his trip to Amsterdam coming out. Come on, where's your Christmas   charity?" </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Reluctantly, she returned   the toast and the conversation turned to matters more interesting to young people.   </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In the distance, Ebenezer   saw a shrouded figure approach. From the folds of his cape, a long, bony finger   protruded and beckoned Ebenezer to him. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Are you the Ghost of Tech   Support Future that was promised to me?" he said. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The ghost nodded and again   signalled Ebenezer to follow. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> They trudged through the   darkness until they found themselves outside a funeral directors' office. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Two undertakers were busily   engaged in putting the finishing touches to a coffin. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Good riddance to him I   say," said one, with scarce regard for the sanctity of his profession. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Though he'd never bleedin'   die," said the other, with even less regard. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"When's the funeral?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Don't think it matters,   there'll scarcely be anyone attending. Perhaps they'll just throw him in the   ground and be done with it." They both cackled hysterically. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Who are they talking about?"   said Ebenezer. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The spirit pointed his   finger and suddenly the coffin lid flew open. Aghast, the old misanthrope saw   his own features. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> He sat bolt upright in   bed and saw the first glimmers of day coming through his curtains. It had all   been a dream. And yet the events of the night had left him with a strange feeling.   </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> He put on his shoes and   dashed round to Cratchit, his PFY. He furiously banged on the door and demanded   admittance. </font><P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It was a bleary-eyed PFY   who let him in. </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Whassamatter?" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I've just had the most   amazing experience!" </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Don't tell me," chortled   the PFY. "You've met three spirits like that bloke in the book and you're going   to turn over a new leaf." </font><P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Bollocks to that. In the   long run, we're all dead anyway, might as well have some fun before we go. No,   I've found out the admin password for the Megabank system, come let me show   you how a real bastard behaves..... </font><P>
