You're at a tutorial when the presenter steps up.   He's wearingbeige slacks, shirt, shoes and tie, carries a personnell disorganiserwith his notes on it, and has two cellphones a pager and a large ringof keys and swipe cards strapped to his waist.  You reach for:        A.  The water carafe        B.  The breath mints        C.  The free pens        D.  Your Walkman        E.  Your sleeping Bag2.  Someone beside you CONTINUALLY interrupts to share their personalexperiences and inane questions on the topics discussed.  You:        A.  Embrace their anecdotes as empircal evidence        B.  Draw similarities between their encounters and             possible happenings at your own organisation        C.  Make "Duh" sounds        D.  Wait till morning tea then spill something that            stains down their front.        E.  Wait till morning tea then spill something that            scalds and stains down their front.3.  You're at a talk on cryptography that's got most of the attendees so far out of their depth that they're wearing water wings and calling for snorkels.   Even your eyes are starting to glazeslightly as you hear about XOR-ing data for the 24th time.  To retainyour consciousness, at the morning tea break you:                A.  Take a couple of extra notes        B.  Take out your dictaphone        C.  Take a dangerous amount of caffeine        D.  Take out the handout and tear out the boring bits        E.  Take out the lecturer with a knee to the goolies4.  It was terrible, but you survived.   Your lecturer looks to you alland asks "Any questions?".  You ask:        A.  Could you review the main topics again quickly?        B.  Have you marked this up on the web somewhere?        C.  Who am I?  How did I get here?        D.  Is that the quickest way out?        E.  Anyone fancy a pint?5.  You're evaluating the tutorial and feel like being generous, even though it was the dullest thing since Gate's biography.  You give yourlecturer                A.  8 out of 10 for knowing his/her topic        B.  8 out of 10 for Visual Aids        C.  4 out of 10 for turning up        D.  7 out of 10 for ending 10 minutes early        E.  2 in the goolies that you didn't give him in question 3.</font><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">HOW DID YOU FARE?        Mostly A:                        You're a card-carrying member of the furry tooth                        brigade - there's no hope for you.        Mostly B:                        You're just as bad as (A), only you have a different                        view on it all.   Be careful who you sit by and                         recognise the sound of a cattle prod charging up...                Mostly C:       Stupid - But saveable.  Remember - you have to work                        at it though...        Mostly D:       You talk the talk, and almost walk the walk.  Keep up                        the good work.  Remember a good tutorial is a bad                        holiday.        Mostly E:  (Enter your comments here.  We trust you)</font></PRE>
