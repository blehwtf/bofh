BOFH newbies can tune into previous episodes here. So let's get cracking.<br>BOFH 2000 No. 1<br>It's still dark as I let myself back into my soon-to-be-EX workplace with a spare &quot;backup&quot; access card and stroll into the office after a short break of feigned death...<br>There's nothing like a quick fatality to put the life back into you..<br>Slipping into Mission Control quietly, I notice the PFY, bless him, has a tear or two in his eye as he reaches into my filing cabinet to put my belongings into a plain cardboard box... and a couple more when I slam the drawer on his hand.<br>&quot;Now what have I told you about fingering my possessions?&quot; I ask.<br>&quot;B.. but.. you're... you're.. &quot; he blurts, extricating his fingers gingerly.<br>&quot;.. Alive and well?&quot; I finish.<br>&quot;But.. what about....&quot;<br>&quot;Arty Murray?&quot; I interject again. &quot;Last I saw of him, he'd just plummeted through the shoddily thin sub-basement floor into the building's stormwater outfall pipe and was probably being washed toward the Thames.. Messy business..&quot;<br>&quot;How did you..?&quot;<br>&quot;Escape Unscathed? By a one in a hundred chance, a loop of thickwire Ethernet cable (which I'm sure I told you to remove from a cabling riser over a YEAR ago) was mysteriously stuffed in the faller ducting instead .. where I theoretically wouldn't find it..&quot;<br>The PFY looks away guiltily as I continue...<br>&quot;.. Which hooked round one of my legs on the way down. Causing me considerable personal injury less than a yard of drop later. But don't worry, my extended absence (for recuperation) will of course be charged back to the company, as will the extensive medical bills from Doctors J Beam and Daniels. &quot;<br>&quot;OhI'mSoPleasedYou'reBack!&quot; the PFY gushes with all the self- control of a Microsoft Fan in the Master Bedroom of Gatesland. &quot;Things have been terrible!&quot;<br>&quot;Terrible?&quot; I require.<br>&quot;Everyone at IT's been reshuffled, they're going to put us under the Beancounters, and there's been a freeze on spending.&quot;<br>&quot;So, business as per usual then?&quot;<br>&quot;I DON'T THINK SO!&quot; The boss cries triumphantly, entering the office with all the grace and poise of a large tusk-bearing animal. After 10 buckets of lager.<br>&quot;Why's that?&quot; I ask politely.<br>&quot;Because you don't WORK here any more!,&quot; he cries happily, pointing out the unexplained absence clause in my contract.<br>&quot;Of course I don't work here any more - it was touch and go when I WAS working here. No, I have my sites set on greener pastures. By the way, any Y2K problems?&quot;<br>&quot;It's a nightmare!,&quot; the PFY admits. &quot;You name it, it's failing - even the stuff that's only about six months old.&quot;<br>&quot;Excellent, so my work wasn't in vain then!&quot;<br>&quot;You sabotaged our systems!,&quot; the boss burbles.<br>&quot;Of course not. You said you wanted all our systems Y2K complaint ready.&quot;<br>&quot;I said compl-IA-nt!&quot;<br>&quot;No, you distinctly said COMPLAINT. I know, I kept a copy.&quot;<br>&quot;W... &quot; the boss burbles, nudging his vocab up a fraction.<br>&quot;Mine not to reason why! And if you think it's bad NOW, wait till Feb 29 - some of that microcode is almost viral!&quot;<br>&quot;You'll have to fix it!&quot; the boss cries.<br>&quot;I don't work here any more.&quot;<br>&quot;Yes you do!&quot;<br>&quot;I can't, I'm dead - just like that email you sent to Salaries a couple of months back.&quot;<br>&quot;How did...&quot; the boss starts, answering his own question - obviously been around a bit too long, although that's bound to be sorted our by Feb 29 too.<br>Suffice to say, the conversation went downhill from there, with security helping me find my way back to the street and relieving me of my access card on the way. (Only three more left, which'll be worth gold after the card readers slip into erase-mode for leap day.)<br>So I enter the job market, and find a suitable position within a couple of hours. A couple of hours later I break out my suit from long-term storage and attend an interview.<br>It went fairly well as interviews go - I told them what they wanted to hear, laughed at their IT jokes that were so old they were printed in braille on the back of the UNIVAC, and generally impressed them with my computing worldiness.<br>Sickening, I agree.<br>&quot;Just one question&quot; I chime in: &quot;How agressively do you persue new technology?&quot;<br>&quot;We believe in growth, and now we've got you, we can go 'leading edge'. Sure, it'll cost a bit more, and involve a bit of travel to track down the right solution, but we think it's just the price you have to pay to get ahead of the competition.&quot;<br>&quot;Dosh and Travel, my favourite twinset... Quicker than you can say &quot;I'm on the team!&quot; I'm on the team.<br>. . .<br>&quot;And here's your workstation - it cost a bomb, and it's the latest and fastest, I believe.&quot;<br>&quot;It's a Digital VT1000 'X' terminal! They don't even make them any more.&quot;<br>&quot;Yes, refurbished to top-of-the-line our consultant told us.&quot;<br>&quot;It's Mono!&quot;<br>&quot;Too fast for colour, he said.&quot;<br>A quick scan of the computer room (full of VAXes, Sparc-1s and a couple of NEXTs for show) and facts-of-life talk later appraises him of the shafting that they've been getting.<br>&quot;What should we do?&quot;<br>&quot;Well there's a lot of work, I won't be able to do it on my own. We'll need an IT manager too...&quot;<br>. . .<br>&quot;Yep?&quot; the PFY answers shirtily (I'm so proud - taught him everything you know).<br>&quot;Hi, it's Opportunity - knocking. And give the boss a yell too - I hear there's a vacancy he might be interested in before the end of February.&quot;<br>Just like old times - back in the driver's seat once more...<br><br></font> <hr><hr><p align="center"><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>BOFH   '00. </strong>BOFH goes to Hollywood</font></p><hr><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>So I'm not in a particularly good mood - but what's new?<br>I go to sign up for a First Aid refresher course (in my business it pays to be on the safe side -- you never know when something might go right). Only to find out that I'm not permitted to go because the ratio of First Aid people to staff is already excessive.<br>So I'm going to have to wait until one of the current First Aid certficate holders leaves the organisation before I can spend two days at the pub in work time - I mean, uh, refresh my first aid skills... of course.<br>Ah well, patience is a virtue, and all good things come to those who wait. AND, you win some and lose some, which is what I say to the PFY when we draw straws to see who's going to shut their hand in the door, so we can find out who the current certificate holders are...<br>&quot;Bastard!&quot; the PFY comments - the sore loser, while I palm the bits of broken off straw into the bin where he can't find them. Serves him right for not being professional enough to cheat.<br>And then I spot the other bits of broken off straw in the bin...<br>I'm just about to berate him for bad sportsmanship when the boss rolls in at top speed (ten feet a fortnight) to discuss a printout he's found on the printer.<br>And then I remember that only this morning I was working on the screenplay for a Bastard movie called A Few Good Simms, to star Jack Nicholson as me, Demi Moore as the unrequited love interest and Tom Hanks as the Boss. (I would have used Tom Cruise, but that's just cliche)<br>&quot;What's this?&quot; the boss asks, handing over a wadge of pages. I flip to the end to my favourite part...<br>Bastard: &quot;You want answers?&quot;<br>Boss: &quot;I think I'm entitled to them!&quot;<br>Bastard: &quot;YOU WANT ANSWERS?&quot;<br>Boss: &quot;I want the truth!&quot;<br>Bastard: YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH!<br>Son, processes live on a system that has finite resource. Resources guarded by people with System Admin experience! Who's going to look after that system? You? The support guy who drools so much he has a drip tray?<br>I have a greater responsibility than you can possibly fathom.<br>You weep for lost sessions and curse system admins - you have that luxury! You have the luxury of not knowing what I know - that session killing, while tragic, saves resource - And my existence, while incomprehensible and expensive to you - saves resource!&quot;<br>You don't want the truth because deep down, in places you don't like to talk about at user group meetings, WANT me on the system - you NEED me on the system!&quot;<br>We use words like &quot;I/O wait&quot;, &quot;Pagefaults&quot;, and &quot;CPUtime&quot;, as a backbone of a life spent sorting out user-caused problems. You use them as a cop-out for downtime at Management meetings.<br>I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a person who connects and disconnects under the very blanket of the very performance I provide, then QUESTIONS the manner in which I provide it. I'd rather you left a nice message with helldesk.<br>Or read a linux admin manual and checked out the performance monitors. Either way, I don't give a DAMN what you think you are entitled to!&quot;<br>Boss: &quot;Did you kill -9 the Database Server?&quot;<br>Bastard: &quot;I did my job - I kept the system running!&quot;<br>Boss: &quot;Did you kill -9 the Database Server?!&quot;<br>Bastard: &quot;YOU'RE GODDAM RIGHT I DID!&quot;<br>. . .<br>Having looked over the page, I give the boss his answer<br>&quot;It's a printout of that movie - whatever it is - one of the staff must have printed it&quot;<br>I slap it into the recycling bin before he thinks of grabbing it back, then go on the offensive.<br>&quot;Was that all you came in for?&quot;<br>&quot;No, no, Apparently someone's complained that they gave you a tape of data to load onto the system and you erased it - claiming it was virus protection an-&quot;<br>&quot;So did we find a virus on the tape?&quot;<br>&quot;Of course not - it was erased!&quot;<br>&quot;Sounds like a good protection mechanism to me!&quot;<br>&quot;You can't bloody erase people's data when- &quot;<br>&quot;We didn't erase their data, the tape was blank when it got here,&quot; I say, nipping his indignation off in the bud.<br>&quot;And what about their second tape, which they had verified before they had it sent?&quot;<br>&quot;There was no sec...&quot; I start, then notice the PFY doing a very thorough job of examining the ceiling tiles for signs of stress.<br>&quot;..ondary data on those tapes. Just the labels and that was it.&quot;<br>&quot;I'll show you!&quot; the PFY chimes, entering the conversation at long last, dragging the boss into the computer room to gaze upon the tape stackers.<br>Barely a minute later he's back... alone.<br>&quot;Ohmigoodness,&quot; he gasps, &quot;there's been a terrible accident! A tape library's tipped over onto the boss's foot and he's trapped!&quot;<br>Mission Accomplished.<br>Scant seconds later we have all the department First Aiders in the computer room discussing the best way to treat a crushed foot.<br>. . .<br>&quot;Strange that the Halon system activated,&quot; the PFY says later, down at the pub, discussing the recent resignation of two of our first aiders.<br>&quot;Yeah. Hey - wanna do a first aid certificate?&quot;<br>&quot;What does it involve?&quot;<br>&quot;Another pint for me to start with...&quot; Wanted: Bastard Operators to man helldesk<br>By:<br>Posted: 27/01/2000 at 09:29 GMT<br>BOFH 2000 No.2So the PFY has joined me at my new workplace after being &quot;let go&quot; on the grounds of &quot;technical differences&quot;. Apparently, he thought the CEO's laptop would survive the drop from the boardroom window, and everyone else didn't.<br>True, he was correct... thanks to the &quot;freak&quot; appearance of one of the more annoying security guards, scanning window ledges in response to an anonymous tip-off about a potential jumper.<br>So we're now stuck at a Meet-the-troops meeting where we get introduced to all our new cow-workers.<br>And what a bunch they are. There's a couple of ancient code-hacks who look like they were on the design team for the atom, a screwdriver jockey who seen more accidental volts than a deathrow successful candidate, and three creepy types who just HAVE to be consultants.<br>&quot;Where's the helpdesk people?&quot; I feel obliged to ask, once the meeting looks like it's underway, and I've laid on some side bets with the PFY about who's who.<br>&quot;Oh there's no Helpdesk as SUCH,&quot; Consultant Type No.1 responds. &quot;There's us three Apps Integrators,&quot; (the PFY hands over five quid), &quot;Hardware support,&quot; (and another five quid as Voltman is identified), &quot;and our Coding Engineers,&quot; (10 quid for the hat-trick). &quot;And anything WE can't handle, we pass on to the Systems Guy. Guys. You!&quot;<br>So it looks like we'll be expecting lots of calls about shoelaces, On/ Off switches and life in general.<br>&quot;So there's no helpdesk?&quot;<br>&quot;No. People call you. We've always found it works well,&quot; our new Head of Dept. replies, entering the room fashionably late, personnel disorganiser in hand.<br>&quot;Well we'll need phones then.&quot;<br>&quot;There are phones in your office.&quot;<br>&quot;No, there's nothing there, just some tables and desks,&quot; I respond.<br>&quot;And Workstations,&quot; the Head replies, obviously referring to the Anchor Substitutes the PFY and I had tossed into the skip on the building site across the road early in the morning.<br>After the phones...<br>&quot;Workstations?&quot; the PFY asks innocently.<br>&quot;Yes, top of the line kit we got from the Vendor just last year. Plugged into the UPS units beside your desk.&quot;<br>&quot;UPS Units?&quot; I add, with a similar angelic disposition.<br>&quot;Are you sure you got the right office?&quot; one of the Consultants asks, attempting to resolve the situation.<br>&quot;Positive, my name's on the door!&quot; I respond.<br>Ten minutes (and one mass exodus from the meeting to our office) later, it's official. We've been robbed!!!<br>Apparently, thieves slipped past security, stole some shonky old hardware, the phones and some very heavy UPS units (So heavy we had to stop twice for rests) and the Visitors log.<br>Would you believe it.<br>&quot;The Bastards!&quot; the PFY cries, pathetically trying to make some mileage out of the tragedy. &quot;They stole my Walkman.&quot;<br>&quot;I shouldn't worry,&quot; the Head comments. &quot;Company Insurance covers any loss of personal ite...&quot;<br>&quot;Good Lord I hope they didn't take my... Portable DVD player with a selection of New Release movies!!!&quot; I cry, seeing the open gate... &quot;Oh NO!&quot;<br>A pair of dubious eyes are cast my way, but by this time I'm ready with the excuse. &quot;I thought I'd treat myself as a celebration for the new job!&quot;<br>The PFY's disgusted (that he didn't go higher... it looks too suspicious now) but it looks like my blatant fabrication has been accep...<br>&quot;Did you keep the Receipts?&quot; our helpful Consultant-Type No.1 chirps, shortly before a full-height hard drive (precariously balanced on the edge of a table -- as all full-height hard drives should be) falls on his foot.<br>And wouldn't you know it, the PFY accidentally knocks over a bookshelf, in his scramble to render aid, rendering unconsciousness instead.<br>&quot;Oh dear,&quot; the PFY mutters apologetically.<br>Consultant Types No.2 and No 3. offer useful first aid suggestions about Shock, etc... this comes in very handy when Consultant Type No.2 comes into contact with a paper clip which had managed somehow to get wedged into the phase pin of a wall socket...<br>...Doubly so when the Consultant Type No.3 misdiagnosed the rigor as Parkinson's and tried to help him to a chair...<br>Not a bad haul for the first day of work...<br>Everyone survived (sadly)... except for an ancient code hack sitting quietly in the corner... or to be more precise being dead quietly... it's not easy to tell the difference with these guys...<br>The ancient code hack wasn't even one of our troops... he had booked in the room for an earlier meeting, died in his chair, and never booked out.<br>And so it is a couple of days later, with a great technical manpower shortage, we're interviewing for Helldesk Operators...<br>&quot;And any experience with Windows...?&quot; I ask<br>&quot;3.1 yes. And I've used 95 once or twice&quot;<br>NEXT!<br>&quot;A user has a browser problem. What's the first thing you'd ask them?&quot; the PFY asks.<br>&quot;What magazine they reading?&quot;<br>NEXT!<br>&quot;A user has just changed their NT password and is now unable to login with it. Will it be because they set their password with the Caps key down?&quot; I ask, hinting helpfully.<br>&quot;No, it's probably because their system has been hacked. No, it's probably got a virus.&quot;<br>. . . .<br>&quot;So how did it go?&quot; the Head asks, at the end of the day.<br>&quot;Well, they're all so.... equal,&quot; the PFY replies.<br>&quot;So what did you do?&quot;<br>&quot;What we always do in these situations.&quot;<br>&quot;Not the one with the biggest...&quot;<br>&quot;No, we just drew names out of a hat. They start next week.&quot;<br>And so does the war... <br><br></font><hr><hr><p align="center"><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>BOFH   '00. </strong>BOFH unmasks the Printer Smasher</font></p><hr><p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>  So I'm into the swing of things at the new workplace and everything seems to   be running as bad as expected. The company's computing and networking is so   old it qualifies for a pension (and disability too).<br>  The new helldesk people are everything we hoped for and less, as is continually   proven by their penchant for handing any call with a computing buzzword onto   us.<br>  Some form of re-education is needed. Meantime, there are phones to answer.<br>  &quot;Hello, is that the operators?!&quot; a voice demands.<br>  &quot;Yes it is, how can I help you?&quot; I ask, pleasant as can be.<br>  &quot;The bloody printer in the 3rd floor documents room has gone off again.&quot;<br>  &quot;By 'off 'you mean?&quot;<br>  &quot;It's not printing. It's NEVER bloody printing! You guys fix it, then an   hour later it breaks again!&quot;<br>  &quot;I see. Which printer is it?&quot;<br>  &quot;The grey one.&quot;<br>  &quot;Yes, but which printer is that?&quot;<br>  &quot;The one by the window.&quot;<br>  &quot;Ok, pretend I just started here and have NO idea what you're talking about.   Do you know what the queue name is, or what the printer is called?&quot;<br>  &quot;A Laserwriter II&quot;<br>  &gt;Rocket Scientist Alert&lt;<br>  &quot;No, I mean what... It doesn't matter. Does it break down all the time?&quot;<br>  &quot;Yeah, it's ALWAYS being fixed.&quot;<br>  &quot;Right. In that case, go into the documents room and push it off the table   onto the floor.&quot;<br>  &quot;Pardon?&quot;<br>  &quot;Push it onto the floor. Actually, it's based on a Canon engine and they're   fairly robust. Best thing to do would be to stand on the table and throw it   on the floor. Two or three times should be enough. Then say it fell or something.&quot;<br>  &quot;You can't be serious!&quot;<br>  &quot;Look, it's probably done 5 squillion pages and got electric arthritis.   It won't be replaced till it's completely stuffed, and if I fix the paper jam   it's most probably got, it's only going to break again in a week or so, isn't   it?&quot;<br>  &quot;I suppose you're...&quot;<br>  &quot;Or course I'm right, I'm the bloody operator. BUT, if you give it a bit   of gravity maintenance it'll be ruined beyond fixing, and you'll get a nice   new printer - possibly a colour one so you'll get to see Miss Kornikova in all..&quot;<br>  &quot;How did you know a..&quot; he gasps.<br>  (complete newbie)<br>  &quot;..her natural beauty and it'll print so fast you won't have to wait until   out-of-work hours to queue them!&quot;<br>  &quot;I...&quot;<br>  &quot;See my point? Of course you do.&quot;<br>  &quot;But they'll..&quot;<br>  &quot;Do nothing. Just say you the printer wasn't on the table squarely. Of   course, as a cover story you'd want to mention to a couple of workmates beforehand   that you have a slight obsessive-compulsive orderly nature - nothing over-the-top,   and you're home and hosed!&quot;<br>  &quot;But they'll know I did it on purpose!&quot;<br>  &quot;Puleeeeze! Who'd believe you actually did it on purpose? You'd have to   be a loony to do that. The odd person might wonder about it, but like I said,   only a loony would do it. But remember to mention the tidying thing or it'll   look a bit strange that you wanted to move the printer...&quot;<br>  &quot;You think it'll work?&quot;<br>  &quot;I *KNOW* it'll work!&quot;<br>  &quot;Why don't you do it then?&quot;<br>  &quot;I've already got a colour printer. And it prints glossy pictures too.   Why, with that and the laminator on the 4th floor you could have yourself a   waterproof piccy that you could take int..&quot;<br>  &quot;I'll do it!&quot;<br>  &quot;Excellent - And remember the orderly thing.&quot;<br>  &quot;Yep!&quot;<br>  I ring off and call security - just like old times.<br>  &quot;Hello.&quot;<br>  &quot;Hi,&quot; I blurt, &quot;Simon, Operations - I think I found the guy who's   been smashing up all the printers around the building -- he rang me up bragging   about it. I traced the call to the 3rd floor, I think he's planning to do over   one of the printers up there!&quot;<br>  &quot;I'll get right onto it!&quot; the guard blurts, slamming the phone and   no doubt waddling to the lift at full speed.<br>  I get there in time to witness the grand finale where my caller gets a truncheon   in the groin and a quick trip to the Security office.<br>  &quot;He's been very upset with the printer lately,&quot; the kindly old wrinkle   at reception tells me, &quot;but I never thought it would come to this. He's   obsessive-compulsive, you know!&quot;<br>  &quot;Sad isn't it?&quot; I respond, sympathetically flashing my ID Swipe card.   &quot;Which was his desk? - I'd better make sure he's logged out.&quot;<br>  She points me to a cubicle and I kill a little time dragging his files into   the trash. Except the Kornikova snaps of course - they go straight into the   OPS share with all the other good stuff. For a couple of further nails into   the old coffin, I delete anything he's got access to on his departmental share,   then shut the machine down.<br>  . . .<br>  &quot;Sounds to me like the typical 'workplace disenfranchised user complex'   - we see it all the time.&quot; I say, consoling the boss over the phone, &quot;One   day, out of nowhere, they just crack and try to subvert the system from within.&quot;<br>  &quot;Terrible,&quot; the boss agrees, &quot;But it's an isolated occurrence?&quot;<br>  &quot;Hard to tell&quot; I murmur, slapping some heat-sensitive glue onto the   back of another blank sheet of A4 and picking a company printer at random, &quot;Hard   to tell..&quot;</font></p><p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>  </font> </p><hr><hr><p align="center"><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>BOFH   '00. </strong>BOFH goes to Hollywood</font></p><hr><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>So I'm not in a particularly good mood - but what's new?<br>I go to sign up for a First Aid refresher course (in my business it pays to be on the safe side -- you never know when something might go right).

(Reflection in the spectacles.)<br>&quot;So, do you have a Requisition form?&quot; I ask, knowing full well that if I leave his office without a signed order, he'll clear his machine and rescind his goodwill quicker than OS2 goes down.<br>&quot;No, but there's one in the secretaries' office.&quot;<br>A good volley, but not good enough. Time to crank up the heat...<br>&quot;How about you print one to your printer - before you forget,&quot; I respond, moving towards his screen AND a printer with rather a lot of pages that look to be recently printed.<br>&quot;AH!

The Car Sales-like pitch...<br>&quot;What would you be wanting to use it for?&quot;<br>Step One of how to REALLY get on my tits: when your Sales Assistant - who's been in the job since his voice broke three weeks back - decides he's going to ignore the spec you've given him, and designs his own, using the tiny amount of experience gleaned since his nappies were changed...<br>&quot;DHCP server,&quot; I cry, pulling an App out of the air. (But still not sad enough to say &quot;Exchange Server&quot; to get the sympathy vote.)<br>&quot;But you don't need the graphics card you've specced for that!&quot;<br>&quot;Yes I do!

I ring the vendor back and he agrees, after a due amount of lying (i.e. &quot;We sent you the wrong order - but you could still change your mind,&quot; etc.), to send the machine we'd configured.<br>Two days later my kit arrives - around the same time the Sales guy rings me to find out where all the internals of the machine he sent me have got to.<br>&quot;Had the box been opened?&quot; I ask.<br>&quot;No, it was still factory sealed,&quot; he admits.<br>&quot;So it must have been mis-shipped.&quot;<br>&quot;Yes, I suppose you're right...&quot;<br>&quot;Of course I am! Now, can you do me a favour?&quot;<br>&quot;Uh, yeah.&quot;<br>&quot;Can you tell me where I'd get drivers for a RAID card like the ones you guys ship in Tower Units?&quot;<br>Experience - a great teacher.<br>Like me. <br></font> <br><hr><hr><p align="center"><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>BOFH   '00. </strong>BOFH masters the art of creative accounting</font></p><hr><p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </font><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So   we've got a visitor in at Mission Control for the next couple of days who's   going to upgrade the main financial software package that the company uses.<br>  And wouldn't you know it, his hourly rate (I happen to notice, when his briefcase   accidentally falls open after I trip and insert a paperclip into its lock) is   such that it brings a tear to even MY trained eye -- and I, not being unversed   in the arts of extortion and general larceny -- am fairly hard to surprise.<br>  Of course, his disguising it as a DAILY RATE gives the impression, to naive   types (The Boss, The H.O.D and Technical Contracts Group), that you're getting   a lot more for your money that 7.5 hours.

Can anyone tell me the recommended way to reseat the   DIMMs in this box here?&quot;<br>  No prizes for guessing who's up, complete with wrist strap (which he brought   with him - sadder still) before I can finish the sentence.<br>  &quot;Well on this one you turn the power off at that wall &gt;CLICK&lt; then   flip the key to the unlock position like so &gt;SNICK&lt; push the two buttons   at the back like this &gt;CLICK&lt; then lift the cover up and towards you,   and Bob's your second cousin.&quot;<br>  &quot;Right, and now the reseating?&quot;<br>  &quot;Simple, these are the DIMMs here, and you reseat them by taking them out   like so &gt;ZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzz...&lt;<br>  &quot;Now what has he done wrong here?&quot; I ask the fireworks spectators.<br>  &gt;ZzzzzzZZzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ&lt;<br>  &quot;That's right, he's forgotten to check for a UPS unit in this cardboard   box marked 'Printer Paper'!&quot;<br>  &gt;ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrrr... &lt;<br>  &quot;And he failed to notice that someone's dropped an unfolded paper clip   into the machine which has, by a one-in-a-million chance got connected between   the Phase line in the power supply and the DIMM chip!&quot;<br>  . . .<br>  Of course I switch the UPS off, eventually... ..and he's still bloody going!!<br>  &quot;I can't believe that UPS unit isn't isolated from ground!&quot; he gasps   &quot;It must be faulty - someone should fill out a &gt;ZZZZZZZZZZEEERRRRT!&lt;<br>  &quot;Woopsy,&quot; I cry, as my little helper plops to the ground in a daze.   &quot;Now, can anyone tell me the most important thing about Computing Safety?&quot;   I ask.<br>  &quot;Not to piss you off?&quot; someone murmurs from the back.<br>  And who says you can't teach people things?<br>  </font> </p><hr><hr><p align="center"><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>BOFH   '00. </strong>BOFH tracks down Arsonist</font></p><hr><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>&quot;I'm sorry, but I find this a little hard to believe,&quot; I say, shaking my head in a manner backing my implied convictions.<br>&quot;That's what they said you'd say,&quot; The Personnel Droid says, waving a piece of paper containing some evidence of the latest complaint against the PFY and my good self.<br>&quot;Well, I'm simply flabbergasted.&quot;<br>&quot;Yes, they said you'd say something like that as well,&quot; he replies.<br>&quot;Who's 'They'?&quot; I ask.<br>&quot;Accounts.&quot;<br>&quot;Who in Accounts?&quot; I ask, not really knowing where this is heading.<br>&quot;Everyone.&quot;<br>&quot;Everyone?! How can everyone in accounts have a complaint against me!!?&quot; I cry, still no nearer knowing what exactly is going on.<br>&quot;They say that you deliberately triggered the sprinkler system in their office to annoy them.&quot;<br>&quot;That's preposterous - we don't have any control over the fire system whatsoever - it's completely remotely managed,&quot; I cry, whilst simultaneously wondering just how the PFY must have done it.<br>&quot;I'm well aware of that!&quot; our accuser snaps. &quot;However, the Fire Inspector believes the optical sensors responded to the smoke that billowed out of a machine that had recently been serviced. A machine which was found to be stuffed with oil-soaked newspaper!&quot;<br>Problem solved. You've got to hand it to the PFY, he has a way with combustibles. Not my chosen method of giving a good soaking, but still, worth a couple of brownie points for effort.<br>&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; I respond, doing my bit to cover for the PFY, &quot;but I still can't see what that's got to do with us, as we don't actually service desktop machines any longer. As anyone in accounts will tell you, the service contracts for machines were outsourced, for a hefty sum I might add, to a third party.&quot;<br>&quot;Yes, we've spoken to them, and they say the machine was working perfectly when it left their office.&quot;<br>The Buck Stops There<br>&quot;Well of course they'd say that! What engineer would ever say it was so buggered they sent it back? The thing could be ON FIRE IN THE COMPUTER ROOM and they'd say it was just performing self tests. Engineers LIE - that's the first thing they teach them!&quot;<br>&quot;And what about this then?&quot; my accuser asks, presenting the piece of paper to me.<br>Hmmm. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark, and I'm not talking about French Tourist's breath... The delivery docket for the courier from the service people bears the PFY's signature. Which is ridiculous - the PFY would never use his own signature - he'd either uses someone else's (Typically The Boss's) or slap on a wiggly line that looks like Charles Manson's polygraph.<br>&quot;It's obviously a fake,&quot; I respond, having my doubts nonetheless.<br>&quot;Well it just so happens that I have a specimen signature - supplied BY Accounts - for a purchase order he recently filled out. And would you look at that - it's a perfect match.&quot;<br>&quot;Yes, thanks Cilla,&quot; I respond, comparing the two signatures, &quot;but doesn't it strike you as odd that the signatures ARE a perfect match?&quot;<br>&quot;Not at all, it just proves he's not very careful!&quot;<br>A small amount of haggling later the Personnel bloke is forced to accept that the PFY's signature counts for nothing - anyone could have tampered with the parcel between delivery and desktop. Though he wants to speak with the PFY alone about it.<br>&quot;I'll see what he's doing today&quot;, double clicking on the &quot;Calendar&quot; icon on the PFY's desktop. <br>Unbeknown to all, an SMS message immediately rockets thru to the PFY's cellphone to indicate he should go into hiding. Useful things those desktop calendars.<br>&quot;Oh, look at that!&quot; I cry, pointing at the error message on the screen &quot;His calendar is corrupt.&quot;<br>&quot;Wasn't it corrupt the other day when I was looking for him?&quot; the boss asks, smelling a medium-sized rodent.<br>&quot;Yes,&quot; I respond, &quot;I blame large software houses with poor quality control!&quot;<br>Eventually, The Boss and The Personnel Droid get sick of waiting and disappear to greener pastures after extracting a promise from me to let them know the MOMENT the PFY shows up. I while away the time by examining the evidence; I make couple of phone calls and reach my conclusion.<br>Later that afternoon, I meet the PFY in the lift and I spend some quality &quot;Emergency Stop&quot; time filling him in on the details. A blip on my pager tells me that my quarry has just swiped itself out of the office and into the lift area.<br>&quot;Going down?&quot; I ask pleasantly, as the beancounter concerned looks up, startled.<br>Half a floor later we stop for some more quality time.<br>&quot;So why'd you set your machine on fire?&quot; I ask.<br>&quot;I didn't set my mach...&quot;<br>&quot;Don't lie to me. I know you picked up the machine from the couriers, I know you faked my assistant's signature from the copy of the order you were processing, and I know the paper inside the machine was the Financial Times - which, because of the lack of breasts and sport, has only two readers in the building - the CEO and you.<br>AND, you were absent when the excreta hit the airconditioning...&quot;<br>&quot;I...&quot; he starts<br>&quot;Did it?&quot; the PFY suggests<br>&quot;I...&quot;<br>&quot;Why?&quot; I ask, intrigued.<br>&quot;BECAUSE I CAN'T STAND THEM!&quot; he blurts, &quot;ALWAYS BLOODY ASKING ME INANE BLOODY QUESTIONS!!!! 'What does this message mean?'; 'Where's the ANY key?', 'How do I get out of this program?`, `What's a good password?' I HATE IT, THEY CAN'T LEAVE ME ALONE!&quot;<br>Suddenly it all becomes clear. Ever since last week's tutorial session, departments are annoying their own people instead of us! <br>&quot;I can... Empathise with you,&quot; the PFY says, switching the Emergency Stop button off. &quot;Now you know what we feel like some days. But using my signature... &quot;<br>After his profuse apology we let him go and get back to Mission Control. I have to admit that it's good to have a kindred spirit in Accounts. Someone who we can see eye to eye with. Someone who understands the idiots we have to deal with. Someone who's going to get blamed for all the oil-soaked newspaper that the PFY and I are going to be stuffing into machines tonight.<br>Yes, it sure is good... <br></font><hr><hr><p align="center"><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>BOFH   '00. </strong></font></p><hr><p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <br>  BOFH plays with Maggot<br>  By:<br>  Posted: 17/03/2000 at 14:34 GMT<br>  BOFH 2000: Episode 10<br>  &quot;But my password CAN'T have expired,&quot; the user whines down the line   at me &quot;I only updated it this morning!&quot;<br>  &quot;If by UPDATED you mean changed it from 'maggot21' to 'maggot22', you're   out of luck I'm afraid, the new password system won't permit you to do that   any longer.&quot;<br>  &quot;But I like the word Maggot!&quot;<br>  &quot;And I like the words Grievous Bodily Harm, but I don't use them as a password.   Not any more, anyway. &quot;<br>  &quot;But I've never had these problems before!&quot; he wheedles.<br>  &quot;That's right - the password change checker we had in place before today   would have let you change your password to anything - even a single letter.&quot;<br>  &quot;Really?&quot; the user gasps, obviously thinking about how much time they   might have saved in logins..<br>  &quot;Yes really.

How does it work?&quot;<br>  &quot;Well the Speech Recog's a piece of turd, but luckily the technical vocab   required is fairly small, so it's pretty accurate. And the reason people call   us is always fairly much the same, so it works out pretty well. The Stress detection   is used to see how quickly you get wound up and stashes it, along with the conversation,   for our future reference...&quot;<br>  &quot;Ok&quot; the machine responds &quot;I think we may have sorted this problem   out...&quot;<br>  &quot;I.e. deleted all your shared files, changed your password to WONKER and   arranged to have your car towed,&quot; I comment.<br>  &quot;...although it may take an hour or so for the System synchronisations   to get propagated to your desktop.&quot;<br>  &quot;And there's the sign-off.

So what was the Message Protocol Middleware software anyway?&quot;<br>  &quot;A patch of a public domain email package with your company's logo in the   startup banner.&quot;<br>  &quot;Smooth. How come you know so much about it?&quot;<br>  &quot;It's my brochure!&quot; the PFY admits smugly.<br>  &quot;YOU'RE MOONLIGHTING CRAP SOFTWARE!?!?&quot; I cry, mildly disappointed   in the lack of the PFY's character, &quot;Without cutting me in!?&quot;<br>  &quot;Nah, you're the second brochure - 'Undisputed Leader in Platform Independent   Data Transferral'...&quot;<br>  &quot;?&quot;<br>  &quot;FTP. With your Company's banner, etc.&quot;<br>  &quot;What's it wholesaling at?&quot;<br>  &quot;The whole package - four quid per licensed user.&quot;<br>  &quot;Bugger.&quot;<br>  &quot;Too expensive?&quot; the PFY asks.<br>  &quot;No, I just bagged it in front of The Boss. Now he'll need more convincing.&quot;<br>  &quot;Damn. We could fake a Press Release from Gartner?&quot;<br>  &quot;Too obscure for him - he doesn't even know who they are!&quot;<br>  &quot;Photoshop-enhanced photo of Gates holding a copy of the software?&quot;<br>  &quot;Warmer, but we really need something with credibility..&quot;<br>  &quot;Fake cover of a Computer Rag!&quot;<br>  &quot;A SCORCHER!&quot; I cry.<br>  . . .<br>  Half a day and one more glossy page later, the boss is sold and the orders are   coming in.

You get called by the most recent in a looooong line of saleswomen for a   large software company. Judging from past experience, she'll be absolutely gorgeous   and know as much about computing as Sonny Bono did about skiing through trees.   She proceeds to tell you that the product she's just received, which, believe   it or not, is the best thing that she's ever seen. You know immediately:<br>  A. It's an excellent and well-researched product<br>  B. It's probably a fairly good product<br>  C. It's crap<br>  D. There is no product, they're selling vaporware, but you're going to buy one   anyway.<br>  2. An Engineer visits your site and, after setting a new speed record for ripping   the guts out of your kit and stuffing most of it back in the box, pronounces   it fixed and ready for action. This means:<br>  A. It'll work till he gets back to the office<br>  B. It'll work till he gets to his car<br>  C. It'll work till he gets in the lift<br>  D. He's turned it off at the wall so that it won't catch fire till he's out   of the building<br>  3. One of your users calls up to see what sort of back-ups you keep. He assures   you that he has NOT deleted any files at all, and his system is sound. This   means:<br>  A. He's just checking on back-up policy out of interest<br>  B. He's deleted a file that it would take a small amount of time to recreate<br>  C. He's deleted a file that it would take a large amount of time to recreate<br>  D. He's deleted someone ELSE's file, and now knows not to own up to it<br>  4. The beancounters deep-six one of your equipment purchase orders because they   say it's too expensive. What they REALLY mean is:<br>  A. It's too expensive<br>  B. It's slightly expensive, and more research might find a less expensive option.<br>  C. They say that to anything over 50 quid.<br>  D. They want a morning of power surges and file share outages.<br>  5. Your Boss rolls into your office with a fist full of Purchase orders that   haven't yet been signed. He tells you that he's going to need justification   documents for the kit you've proposed to buy. He obviously means:<br>  A. He has to answer to the Head of Department like everyone else<br>  B. He has to justify expenditure like everyone else<br>  C. He's no what the kit IS, but doesn't want to look stupid.<br>  D. He's got his eyes set on a new laptop+desktop combo, which your purchases   are going to put the kybosh on.<br>  6. Security sends a memo around informing everyone that they'll be running their   usual site-safety workplace/office check in the next few days. What they really   mean is:<br>  A. Office safety is paramount and they're concerned about accidents<br>  B. Office security is paramount and they're concerned about break- ins<br>  C. They've noticed the similarity between the marks on the door of the vending   machines and the pry bar that you keep for &quot;floor tile removal&quot;<br>  D. The head of security wants his safe back.<br>  7. You're reading a trade mag which tells you that a certain popular operating   system of the 80s is making a comeback. In plain terms this means:<br>  A. Serious development has produced results at OS/2 central<br>  B. Serious money has produced results at VMS central<br>  C. Guru Meditation has produced results at Amiga central<br>  D. Alcohol has produced results at the editorial office<br>  8. You're looking for new staff when a slave trader rings you with a fantastic   person to join your team. From your experience with slave traders, you know:<br>  A. The applicant will be perfect for your needs<br>  B. The applicant will probably be OK<br>  C. The applicant will probably recognise a computer if they see one<br>  D. The applicant won't find their way to your office<br>  9. You're at a trade show where the latest and greatest hardware is available   for perusal. The demonstrator of the kit in front of you (which looks EXACTLY   like the kit the boss bought last year) tells you that their product is the   new version with twice the performance for half the cost!!! You realise:<br>  A. The kit is AMAZING!<br>  B. The kit sounds amazing<br>  C. The boss would think it was amazing<br>  D. It's amazing they had the balls to turn up at the show!<br>  How did you do?<br>  Mostly A<br>  You are green aren't you? Are you sure you're not Management reading forbidden   literature?

In fact, I'd go so far as to say that The Boss is grooming   him for the vacancy in IT.&quot;<br>  &quot;There's no vacancy in IT!&quot; <br>  &quot;Oh, didn't I tell you?&quot; I comment. &quot;You're about to be let go.   Something to do with unprofessional conduct.&quot;<br>  &quot;What?&quot;<br>  &quot;Yes, apparently they think that you throwing that Beancounter's monitor   out the window was a little over the top.&quot;<br>  &quot;I was degaussing it by moving it through a static magnetic field.&quot;<br>  &quot;Static Magnetic field?&quot;<br>  &quot;The *Earth's* Magnetic field!&quot;<br>  &quot;Of course. However, I think the bit they objected to was that it was tied   to the beancounter concerned.&quot;<br>  &quot;It got caught on his clothing!&quot;<br>  &quot;Caught with a double reef knot?&quot;<br>  &quot;I don't know anything about that&quot; he lies unconvincingly. &quot;Anyway,   how do YOU know about it?&quot;<br>  &quot;I happened to receive a piece of misaddressed email on the subject.&quot;<br>  &quot;Misaddressed to whom?&quot;<br>  &quot;The CEO.&quot;<br>  &quot;And how's that misaddressed?&quot;<br>  &quot;In the manner that anything you want kept secret shouldn't be addressed   to the CEO.&quot;<br>  &quot;Ah.

And then I'll have   the pleasure of the new guy's company till he decides to further his career   elsewhere.&quot;<br>  &quot;So I should reapply for the contract in two weeks?&quot;<br>  &quot;One week should be sufficient.&quot;<br>  So sure enough, it happens - the PFY gets to go to an INTERVIEW from which he   doesn't return.

He's so green he needs pruning!<br>  Even worse, he's conscientious and punctual and my best efforts at dissuading   him from staying with the company appear to be ineffectual - he's completely   devoted to the intricacies of solving computing problems. My main concern now   is that the users are going to expect the same service level from me - wandering   up to their office every time they've stuffed about with their monitor settings   or changed their default paper type.<br>  It's not going to happen!

It can't be   a fault?! Not in my kit.<br>  But it appears to be so. Following my nose to an area where the smell is strongest   I notice a rather old disk unit with a heat-marked label on its front panel.   It doesn't look good.<br>  I check out our maintenance schedule, and of course, it's been discontinued   as the boss's thinking in this manner is &quot;If it hasn't misbehaved in the   past it's unlikely to fail in the future&quot; - The Yorkie Terrier rule of   maintenance.<br>  So it's stuffed, and - being ancient - the replacement cost of the full height   disk is the same price you'd expect to pay for an entire desktop computer with   10 times the Processor Power and Disk Space.

They buy it, which only goes to   show...<br>  Something has to be done, if only because the PFY will be back next week and   is bound to ridicule my inattention.<br>  . . .<br>  So after she comes in to fix the console keyboard which bears all the hallmarks   of having been hit with a large blunt instrument, but which in fact is just   suffering from wear and tear, I slip five brand spanking new drives into her   toolbox when she's not looking, and leave her to her thoughts.<br>  Thoughts which I cannot begin to fathom when I find the five drives later that   afternoon, sitting on top of a machine in the computer room. Where a tape stacker   used to be.<br>  Something has to be done.<br>  I call her company immediately, and ask to be put through to her. Eventually,   she answers and it's time to sort things out once and for all.<br>  &quot;So, how about a quick drink after work?&quot;<br>  She accepts and we agree to meet at a nice place out of the city later in the   evening.<br>  Later arrives. We make small talk, till get down to business and ask her why   she's such a klepto.<br>  &quot;Oh, I'm not a klepto, it's just boring doing the same old thing day after   day. So I distract myself relieve the boredom.&quot;<br>  &quot;Which explains why you took the stacker and left the drives.&quot;<br>  &quot;The stacker, 4 of your pens, your coffee mug and the book you used as   a backing to sign the Work Done form.&quot;<br>  &quot;The visitors book?!?&quot; I gasp.<br>  &quot;I spose so, I didn't look. The more blatant the theft, the more interesting   it is. I suppose you didn't notice that your office is down by two wheelie chairs   then?&quot;<br>  Yes, it could be love.<br>  To cut a long story short, we have a great evening, ending with me walking her   to the tube station AND staying with her till her tube arrives.<br>  And stealing her wallet - lets face it, you can't let a catch like that get   away... <br>  </font></p><hr><hr><p align="center"><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>BOFH   '00. </strong></font></p><hr><p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <br>  BOFH and The Mahariji<br>  By: Simon Travaglia<br>  Posted: 08/05/2000 at 11:23 GMT<br>  BOFH 2000: Episode 17<br>  &quot;You're LOSING IT!&quot; The PFY cries, in a manner that could be construed   only as unkind.<br>  &quot;I think you&#8217;re...&quot; I respond, defensively, being cut off mid   sentence by the PFY's next outburst.<br>  &quot;YOU ARE! Look, you're even filling in Job Sheets! 'Reset user's password'.   Helped a user with a Microsoft Office install'.&quot;<br>  &quot;Just noting work done to aid the service process.&quot;<br>  &quot;You HATE job forms - You used to steal them from the helpdesk just to   prevent them getting work bonuses! You said it was Virtual Brownnosing.&quot;<br>  &quot;I said it was VIRTUALLY Brownnosing. Virtual Brownnosing's where you get   one of those greeting card places to send your boss a birthday card every year.   In any case, that's a very negative point of view.&quot;<br>  The PFY's next diatribe is pre-empted by the rapid arrival of The Boss.<br>  &quot;Just wanted to thank you for the help with my home machine; it's running   much faster now!&quot;<br>  . . .<br>  &quot;You helped THE BOSS, with a HOME machine!!? You HAVE lost it! It's not   going to affect next week's Contract Renegotiation any!&quot;<br>  &quot;Contract Renegotiation? I have transcended the need for wealth and power   by donating my savings to the Mahariji's trust and don't feel the need to encourage   favour with my superiors.&quot;<br>  SUPERIOR!!! You've gone SOFT!&quot; the PFY cries disgustedly. &quot;I KNEW   something was up when you let that Security Guy get the better of you. The OLD   Bastard would never have let that happen!&quot;<br>  &quot;The OLD Bastard was a relic. Not at all in tune with his aura.&quot;<br>  &quot;His Aura?&quot;<br>  &quot;Yes, the mantra of his personal consciousness.&quot;<br>  &quot;Personal Consciousness?! It's that Engineer, isn't it! She's got you wrapped   around her finger!&quot;<br>  &quot;I have to admit that our relationship was sweet, but the Mahariji showed   me that it was simply a manifestation of my own deep- seated needs. The relationship   ended and I am a fuller person now because of it.&quot;<br>  &quot;You're a fuller Nutter now!&quot;<br>  &quot;I'm sure the OLD Bastard would have responded to that statement with negativity   - probably manufacturing some cataclysmic sequence of events for which you would   be blamed... But I will not. The Mahariji has shown me that helping others is   the only path to true aura maintenance.&quot;<br>  Nutter!&quot; the PFY repeats.<br>  &quot;The Mahariji says that namecalling is a manifestation of sadness. The   Shiny Aura is rewarded by happiness.&quot;<br>  &quot;Fifty quid says I'll be the happier person at the end of the day.&quot;<br>  &quot;A wager? I do not need money!&quot;<br>  &quot;One hundred quid!&quot; he cries.<br>  &quot;I don't rea..&quot;<br>  &quot;FIVE HUNDRED QUID!&quot;<br>  &quot;Please stop!&quot;, I cry. &quot;This is unseemly! I will take your wager   on the condition that you pay my winnings - if it happens - to the Mahariji!&quot;<br>  &quot;Done!&quot;<br>  The deal is struck once my assistant has added a side wager that the loser has   to buy the entire IT department drinks on Friday night - AND listen to their   complaints about service. Not something that even an enlightened individual   would look forward to..<br>  We've barely shaken on it when we're summoned to The Boss's office - no doubt   to receive more thanks for problems solved...<br>  &quot;Ah... I've just had a complaint about some of the service the users have   been receiving!&quot; The Boss mutters sternly, looking in the PFY's direction.<br>  The PFY, as expected, looks away with an expression of innocence...<br>  Sigh.<br>  &quot;I must apologise for my assistant's youth,&quot; I interrupt. &quot;He's   young and impulsive and sometimes doesn't give the client the benefit of the   doubt, but I'm sure that with a little...&quot;<br>  &quot;Enough!&quot; The Boss snaps. &quot;Changing a user's password to a disgusting   word repeated three times isn't what I'd call impulsive - it's a calculated   act!&quot;<br>  &quot;?&quot; the PFY responds, before I can step in for his defence. &quot;Probably   some form of misunderstanding on my assistants part,&quot; I add. &quot;He may   have thought that the user had REQUESTED that password - some of them have a   history of using fairly colourful language when a problem occurs. It may be   that he thought that they were supplying that word as a password - it has happened.&quot;<br>  &quot;Oh yes? And what about telling a user that Microsoft Office installs faster   if you hammer all the developer CDs into the drive at once?&quot;<br>  &quot;I... I..,&quot; I murmur, looking at the PFY in horror.<br>  Which, as it happens, is the same way he's looking at me. Of course he's thinking   of my new credibility as opposed to his (should he claim it was me) and the   500 quid down the gurgler PLUS eight or so hours of people whining about how   the systems used to run faster back when, and how they like one letter passwords...   Not to mention his chances come Contract Renegotiation time...<br>  &quot;Leave it with me,&quot; I murmur to The Boss. &quot;I'll have a little   word with him...&quot;<br>  . . .<br>  &quot;You bastard!&quot; the PFY shouts when we get back to Mission Control.   &quot;This Mahariji stuff's a load of crap! Well laugh again. The deal was 500   quid to the Mahariji, so the cheques going there.&quot;<br>  &quot;Excellent!&quot; I cry. &quot;Would you like me to send you one of our   pamphlets as well - I've just finished one on the Divine Shiny Aura.&quot;<br>  &quot;You're the Mahariji?&quot;<br>  &quot;You betcha! I bought up the office of this New Age fruit- eating commune   after they had a bad batch of apples or something and closed down - and now   have an iron-clad tax haven. For a couple of years anyway! Absolutely brilliant.   So all I have to do is print a couple of pamphlets a year, advertise dull meditation   courses in some well-known magazines, publish a massive yearly loss and I'm   in the clear! Unless of course the Beatles reform..&quot;<br>  &quot;So who should I make the cheque out to?&quot; the PFY asks, sighing heavily.<br>  &quot;The Divine Aura of Tfosorcim Society.&quot;<br>  &quot;Tfosorcim? Microsoft spelt backwards?&quot;<br>  &quot;Like it? - you know, like Inverse Evil.&quot;<br>  &quot;I hate you!&quot;<br>  &quot;Now, now, that's not helping your Aura!!!&quot; <br>  </font></p><hr><hr><p align="center"><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>BOFH   '00. </strong></font></p><hr><p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <br>  IHATEYOU Virus sweeps through BOFH Land<br>  By: Simon Travaglia<br>  Posted: 09/05/2000 at 09:56 GMT<br>  b&gt;BOFH 2000: Episode 18It's not even midday when the boss trundles into the   office when I'm barely into my morning paper.

You're not even the right sex!&quot;<br>  &quot;No, the Virus.&quot;<br>  &quot;HIV? Well, I applaud your honesty in these trying times, but...&quot;<br>  &quot;Not me, the email virus, ILOVEYOU!&quot;<br>  &quot;Oh that&quot;<br>  &quot;Yes! What are we going to do about it?&quot;<br>  &quot;Well the PFY and I have been discussing this at length and we believe   that we will trust our users to follow the simple instructions that we've given   them time and time again - which is 'Don't open attachments from people you   don't know'&quot;<br>  &quot;That's all very well, but someone's bound to do it,&quot; he adds worriedly.<br>  &quot;So you've infected your desktop?&quot; I sigh.<br>  &quot;Uh, no - the secretary's. She asked me to see if it was the Virus.&quot;<br>  &quot;So you opened it to check?&quot;<br>  &quot;Ah.. well..&quot;<br>  &quot;Well indeed. Looks like our Windows 2000 project has a pilot victim. I   mean test subject.&quot;<br>  &quot;Is there nothing we can do?&quot;<br>  &quot;Apart from not opening attachments that is?&quot;<br>  &quot;Uh, yes&quot;<br>  &quot;Not really - a reinstall is far easier, just to be sure.&quot;<br>  &quot;Oh, well could you prepare some documentation about this for noticeboards   and the like?&quot;<br>  &quot;I suppose we could, but we're really a bit more concerned about the 'IHATEYOU'   virus and what will happen if THAT gets here.&quot;<br>  &quot;The IHATEYOU virus? What's that?&quot; he gasps horrified.<br>  &quot;Well it's a derivative of the ILOVEYOU virus, only it's effects are far   more damaging&quot;<br>  &quot;ARE THEY?&quot; he gasps<br>  &quot;Oh yes. It looks like a Notepad document, but in fact does all the usual   stuff plus more.

With an attachment Notepad document entitled   '10 reasons why I hate you'.&quot;<br>  &quot;What was in it?&quot;<br>  &quot;Just 'Because you're a plonker' 10 times over..&quot;<br>  &quot;No virus?&quot;<br>  &quot;Nah, too much effort.

Sadly,   though, with the advent of gas-fired barbecues not many of us get to use it   any more.. But today The Bastard would like ask some questions about your interpretation   of their propaganda.<br>  1.Reading the Advertising blurb for a product which may suit your needs, you   notice the phrase: &quot;Runs on most PC Compatibles&quot;. This means<br>  A. Any X86 box will run it<br>  B. Most X86 boxes will run it<br>  C. Runs on DOS boxes<br>  D. Doesn't run on DOS boxes<br>  E. Doesn't run<br>  2.In the same blurb you see: &quot;Developed by a highly skilled team of programmers&quot;<br>  A. It was developed by a crew of like-minded supergeeks who we managed to lure   away from the space program with large salaries<br>  B. It was developed by a team of grad students working for us nights and weekends<br>  C. It was developed by two grad students as a thesis paper, and we stole it.<br>  D. It was developed my two high school students learning Visual Basic<br>  E. The skills we were talking about were Juggling and Morris Dancing<br>  3.You also notice that it claims to be &quot;fully compatible with international   standards&quot;. This means<br>  A. It adheres to current industry standards<br>  B. It adheres to ad hoc industry standards<br>  C. It adheres to the new standard that they've just made up (See Microsoft Standards)<br>  D. They'll stick to their story about standards, even under interrogation<br>  E. The wrapper will adhere to your foot if you stand on it<br>  4.Finally the brochure mentions &quot;Fully Manned Personal Worldwide Support&quot;,   which really means:<br>  A. There's a support team in every country for 24hr support<br>  B. There's a support team in one country, with 24hr support<br>  C. They've hired one full man for Worldwide Support<br>  D...and by &quot;full&quot; they mean drunk<br>  E...and he only speaks Hindi<br>  5.The accompanying Company Propaganda claims that they are experts in the &quot;Fully   Fault Tolerant&quot; field. That means:<br>  A. They have a large amount of experience in delivering 24x7 applications<br>  B. They have a large amount of experience in using 24x7 applications<br>  C. They know there's 24x7 hours in the week<br>  D..

(There's only SO many   times you can be asked how to change the desktop wallpaper, a password, or tweak   the screen brightness before you feel like stuffing the person's pay-cheque   into the shredder)<br>  I'm just finishing stuffing someone's pay-cheque into the shredder (pre-emptive   strike - the best defence being a good offence and all that) when an early rising   user walks in, wondering why their desktop machine has its cover off.<br>  &quot;Just taking an inventory of the hardware your system's configured with,&quot;   I respond to their inquiry.<br>  &quot;But you already did that last year!&quot; he blurts. &quot;We do it every   year,&quot; I reply, &quot;so we can keep track of all the upgrades that have   occurred and equipment that's been added.&quot;<br>  &quot;Well I hope it goes smoother than last year - I'm sure that my machine   ran a lot slower after you'd run that hardware checking program on it.&quot;<br>  Sigh.<br>  &quot;Sometimes the cataloguing program notes systems anomalies like overclocked   CPUs or misconfigured memory configurations, which will eventually lead to Access   Violation problems and frequent Bug Checks,&quot; I respond, &quot;so we rectify   them.&quot;<br>  *DUMMY MODE ON!*<br>  Of course, I could tell him the real reason - that the cataloguing software   noted that the system concerned REALLY DID have a serious memory anomaly - it   had 64 Meg when 32 would do. No sooner noted than rectified with the aid of   a common household DIMM removal tool. (I could be Father Theresa, my life is   so devoted to helping people).<br>  &quot;Oh. Ok. Well how long will it be till you're done?&quot;<br>  &quot;Oh, I'm finished now,&quot; I cry happily, suppressing a momentary feeling   of guilt as the last of his pay packet disappears into the slot of death. &quot;I'll   just pop the cover back on your box and you'll be back in business!&quot;<br>  &quot;Actually, while you're here, do you mind if I ask you a question?&quot;<br>  &quot;By all means!&quot;<br>  &quot;Well I've been reading about this break-up of Microsoft - will any of   my programs be affected by it?&quot;<br>  &quot;You mean will the change in the corporate structure of company affect   the software made by that company and currently installed on your machine?&quot;<br>  &quot;Yes.&quot;<br>  My feelings of remorse disappear quicker than a hardware warranty after clock-chipping   and I'm back to normal self.<br>  &quot;Well, it's hard to say. You see, what the ruling in effect means is that   Microsoft has become far too powerful and has begun monopolising the market   &#8211; it's the US government's form of a practical joke really.&quot;<br>  &quot;Huh?&quot;<br>  &quot;Well they encourage people to build a big company and pay huge amounts   of tax, and yet when they do so, they say it's bad and tell you that you have   to break it up to be less competitive&quot;<br>  &quot;But weren't they using unfair business tactics?&quot;<br>  &quot;The term 'business' makes the term 'unfair' redundant in that sentence.&quot;<br>  &quot;You sound like you AGREE with them!&quot;<br>  &quot;Can't stand them, to be honest, but that's hardly the point. Now back   to your question - will it affect your desktop?&quot;<br>  &quot;Yes&quot;<br>  &quot;Unfortunately it probably will. Because of the split up, you'll probably   have limitations on the size of documents created with the applications. It   shouldn't affect you a lot - as long as you don't have any documents over 20k   in size&quot;<br>  &quot;But MOST of my documents are over 20k in size - I do the employment contracts.&quot;<br>  &quot;Really?&quot; (This just gets better and better.) &quot;Well what will   happen is that they'll probably set a limit on the amount of pages of data you   can edit at one time. Probably one.&quot;<br>  &quot;ONE PAGE! All of my documents are longer than that. How do I get around   it?&quot;<br>  &quot;Well.. I don't know if I should tell you this...&quot;<br>  &quot;Oh please, it'll kill me to have to split all my documents up.&quot;<br>  &quot;Well.... ..Ok, I spose I can tell you. You have to DELIMIT the documents&quot;<br>  &quot;How?&quot;<br>  &quot;Just go into DOS, and type DEL *.*&quot;<br>  &quot;HEY! Doesn't that Delete them?&quot;<br>  &quot;No, the Delete command is REM - They changed all that years ago - you've   been using Windows too long.&quot;<br>  &quot;Oh.&quot;<br>  &quot;And while you're at it you'll probably want to delimit everyone else's   files too, plus all the ones on the server -I think the delimit command gets   replaced with the new Operating System we're installing later today.&quot;<br>  &quot;Oh, Ok, I'll get right onto it.&quot;<br>  &quot;Good. And while you're at it, you probably want to delimit the NTLDR,   the boot.ini, and everything in the Profiles directory on the disks too - just   to be on the safe side in case they want to split out the Multination Characterisation   of the Interface to the Base Operating System.&quot;<br>  ***DUMMY MODE IRREVOCABLY ON***<br>  &quot;Du-Ok.&quot;<br>  Like shooting fish in a barrel. <br>  </font></p><hr><hr><p align="center"><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>BOFH   '00. </strong></font></p><hr><p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <br>  BOFH gets Blood on His Hands<br>  By: Simon Travaglia<br>  Posted: 10/06/2000 at 12:06 GMT<br>  BOFH 2000: Episode 22<br>  So, as part of the Company-wide lip service to Health and Safety, anyone in   an area deemed potentially dangerous has to go on a First Aid refresher course.   And wouldn't you know it, because of a minor statistical anomaly in the workplace   accident figures, the Computer Room is found to be the most dangerous place   in the Building.<br>  As it should be.<br>  Still, The PFY and I are REQUIRED to attend the course, which isn't so bad when   you consider the company's picking up the Tab for a day off work.<br>  And we do get a shiny first aider badge.<br>  To wear to the pub.<br>  At our respective wakes.<br>  &quot;Yes, that IS the correct way to use a defibrillator,&quot; our instructor   informs The PFY calmly. &quot;However it's not generally the recommended method   for treating a broken arm, which is what we're looking at currently.&quot;<br>  With a sigh The PFY puts down the paddles of the unit, which is no doubt suffering   from a seriously depleted battery and leaves the resuscitation manikin to smoulder   out.<br>  &quot;Now back to broken arms; what's the best treatment for them?&quot;<br>  &quot;It depends on how they were broken..&quot; The PFY answers, beating everyone   in the assembled group for our tutor's attention, like the closet brownnoser   he is.<br>  &quot;Yes, true,&quot; she responds. &quot;If the fracture is what we call an   'Open' fracture, we would want to treat it differently than a normal 'Closed'   fracture.&quot;<br>  &quot;Oh. I was thinking more along the lines of 'did I slam their arm in a   door, and should I give it a twist to make my point - for luck'. Sort of thing.&quot;<br>  &quot;Yessss..&quot; she replies, clearly deciding not to dig any deeper into   that particular quagmire. &quot;Anyway, what we're looking at is whether there   is bleeding associated with the injury or not, and whether there's a necessity   to treat that first.&quot;<br>  The Boss, meantime (here because he too values the idea of a day out of the   office) is looking just a tad queasy - obviously not too keen on the blood idea..<br>  Best go easy on him.<br>  &quot;Blood you say,&quot; I cry loudly, &quot;Would that be like a LOT of blood?&quot;<br>  &quot;Well it depends really on the organs involved, and how they're affected.&quot;<br>  &quot;So the blood could just GUSH out, ALL OVER everything, or if could just   OOOOOZE?&quot;<br>  The Boss is now looking like a Procol Harum song and starting to waver in his   chair, which is the perfect time for an interlude...<br>  &quot;I think we need to get him some fresh air,&quot; I cry, pointing out The   Boss to the instructor.<br>  &quot;Yes, yes, very good idea.&quot;<br>  &quot;I'll bring the shock machine!&quot; The PFY cries, leaping toward the   device in question.<br>  &quot;That won't be necessary&quot; she responds, &quot;All he needs is a little   lie down in some cool air for a minute or two.&quot;<br>  The PFY barely hides his disappointment, but rallies -- by snaffling The Boss's   wallet and standing on his personnel disorganiser -- while helping him to the   window. A gust of fresh diesel fumes to the nostrils and The Boss is back in   the Land of the Living.<br>  &quot;Where's my wallet!?!&quot; he cries, performing his Power on Self Test   true to form.<br>  &quot;Here it is,&quot; The PFY offers, &quot;Just looking after it.&quot;<br>  The Boss scrabbles through it, but everything seems to be intact.<br>  Ten minutes later we've all seen a sling in action and managed to pair up to   give it a try ourselves. I, sadly didn't quite get the hang of it, so to speak,   and mistakenly wrapped the noose - I mean bandage - around The Boss's neck.   And it's true what they say about a well-tied reef knot - it doesn't slip.<br>  After The Boss has his second bout of fresh air, we begin again, pausing during   the bleeding stage for The Boss to recover yet again. Sigh.<br>  The next day we're all back on fine form and I'm showing The Boss some of the   sights of the computer room. He wants to go through every SINGLE bloody accident   that's ever happened in the place and see if our course has covered it - before   he pays this invoice. Sigh.<br>  . . .<br>  &quot;And this is where that engineer slipped and tripped down the raised floor   tile - breaking his arm - which incidentally that accident happened the very   day after he told us that we didn't have 24 hour response..&quot;<br>  &quot;Yes, yes,&quot; The Boss murmurs, ticking off something on his clipboard.   &quot;We'll have to put up warning signs on the walls about that.&quot;<br>  &quot;..Oh! And this is where we had that mild electric shock when wear and   tear on the power cable accidentally connected phase to this cabinet. Nasty   burn and a bit of hysteria there.&quot;<br>  &quot;Yes, perhaps we should make it a rule that everyone entering the room   has to use insulated gloves,&quot; he burbles. <br>  &quot;Ah&quot; The PFY cries, &quot;This is where that consultant who was always   complaining about not having access to the computer room accidentally climbed   on top of the machine. And this is where he broke off one of the smoke detectors   with his head - causing the halon to be released.&quot;<br>  &quot;Really - he broke it off with his head?&quot;<br>  &quot;Near as we can tell - he quit after the accident, so we didn't have a   chance to ask him about it.&quot;<br>  &quot;Yes. Those consultants all have First Aid certificates, don't they? I   know, I've got an idea! Why not let them all have access to the computer room   - which should increase the safety of the area many times over!&quot;<br>  !!!<br>  &quot;Let them into my computer room?&quot; I ask.<br>  &quot;Yes,&quot; The Boss replies happily.<br>  &quot;Well I suppose so,&quot; I respond, ignoring The PFY's look of horror.   &quot;They certainly would have come in handy that time I cut my finger on the   sharp edge of the inside of this cabin... oh look, I've done it again!&quot;<br>  I pull my arm out of the cabinet and sure enough there's a large cut along it   with a generous amount of blood on it.<br>  &quot;And this,&quot; I say, indicating a stretch of floor tile to The PFY,   &quot;is where The Boss fainted that time and &gt;KATHUD&lt; broke &gt;STOMP&lt;   his index finger.&quot;<br>  Desperate times, desperate measures.<br>  You'll get access to my computer room right after you pry the Halon test key   out of my cold, lifeless hands. <br>  </font></p><hr><hr><p align="center"><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>BOFH   '00. </strong></font></p><hr><p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <br>  BOFH: Bad Hair Day<br>  By: Simon Travaglia<br>  Posted: 18/06/2000 at 18:20 GMT<br>  BOFH 2000: Episode 23<br>  I think I'm going to have a seizure. I've tried to calm down, I've counted to   10, I've even played a couple of games of sneaky-cheat Quake II against a couple   of feebs from marketing who can't figure out why they kept exploding when I   shot them with an ordinary looking pistol.<br>  But it's not working. I've had enough. The week has gone on one day too long   and they've finally got to me. The users, The Boss - even the PFY is getting   on my tits....<br>  ..It all started this morning when I had to put a simple proposal in for the   purchase of a swag of new disks to replace the old crap that sits in a standalone   cabinet hanging off a SCSI-1 chain on one of the larger Database machines. Disk   that's so old it's got marks from Noah's screwdriver on the side. And he wasn't   much of an installer if the cabling's anything to go by...<br>  Be that as it may, I slap together a quick document and push it over to The   Boss.<br>  &quot;There's no competing quote for the equipment,&quot; he says, skimming   down the page.<br>  &quot;Company policy is that a competing quote isn't necessary when the purchase   is under 2000 quid,&quot; I respond.<br>  &quot;Yes, but there's several disks here, which, with VAT, totals... 2014 pounds,&quot;   he replies, after bashing some numbers into his desktop calculator and &#8211;   finally - managing to get them in the right order.<br>  So 10 minutes later I'm back in his office with TWO orders for two sets of half   as many disks.<br>  And he signs them off. Well, wanders off to the secretary to borrow her dictionary   to see just whether Disc or Disk is the preferred spelling.<br>  &quot;I can't believe you did two orders to avoid getting a competing quote,&quot;   he says smugly as he returns, just letting me know that I can't put one over   on him.<br>  I've no doubt his smugness will last well up to the time he discovers the wallet   on his desk strangely empty, his coffee cup strangely full, and his voicemail   diverted to a phone sex line.<br>  I take the order up to Beancounter Central, only to find the beancounters won't   be processing it today. (It's Accounts policy to send out all orders in the   morning mail. And by now it's past 11am.) <br>  My offers to type it myself are rejected. There are no exceptions. Rules are   rules.<br>  But that's OK, I can put up with that. Then I get back to Mission Control and   the PFY's having a deep and meaningless with the latest woman of his dreams...<br>  &quot;I *SO* agree&quot; he gushes, gesturing to a console message warning of   a tape drive needing a cleaning cartridge.<br>  Being the benevolent type, I slap the tape in the drive and pop down to an early   lunch.<br>  And wouldn't you know it, I'm just getting my second pint in when a group of   furry-teethed geeks from the electronics company down the road bowl in.<br>  &quot;And I said to him: 'you can't port Debian to a car computer - IT'S NOT   AN OPEN SYSTEM' - WAAAAA HA HA HA!&quot; one of them cries, setting the rest   of them off in a fit of laughter.<br>  ...<br>  I make a break back to work only to find The PFY on the phone, the Tape warnings   still unresolved, a consultant wanting someone to help him with his computing   problem (which he no doubt caused), and a couple of users stacked up on hold   because all the helldesk people have gone to lunch at the same time...<br>  Something has to be done.<br>  I get rid of the users in record time with a two-word solution involving sex   and travel (disguising my phone line as a helldesk extension in case any of   the callers has a digital phone), and then decide to tackle the PFY problem.<br>  I indicate the tape warnings that he's been ignoring for the last hour or two   then show him the plug of death, which to all intents and purposes looks like   a plug with a single throw heavy duty switch where the cable should be. Not   knowing what it is, the PFY seems unfazed.<br>  Which incidentally is what his desk and phone are when I plug in then push the   button, grounding the live wire and popping the circuit breaker.<br>  &quot;What the hell di..,&quot; The PFY starts, stopping abruptly when he sees   me passing a small parcel to him. He knows two things: (1) the mailroom only   delivers parcels at 10 and 3, and (2) most parcels don't have highly conductive   tin foil on them. &quot;I'll just get those tapes then..&quot;<br>  Problem solved, it remains only for the attack of the killer consultant with   his problem of doom. Sure enough, seeing me alone in the office, separated from   the herd as it were, he decides to strike.<br>  &quot;I've been having a few problems installing NT,&quot; he burbles, wandering   over and showing me a piece of paper with the &quot;error text&quot; written   on it. &quot;There's no floppy in the drive,&quot; I murmur.<br>  &quot;No, there ISN'T a floppy in the drive!&quot; he cries triumphantly.<br>  Sigh<br>  &quot;The machine doesn't recognise the CD drive and NEEDS a boot floppy to   load the NT disk,&quot; I respond.<br>  &quot;No it doesn't! It's never needed one before.&quot;<br>  Double sigh<br>  &quot;It does. It's uncommon, but it happens.&quot;<br>  &quot;Look, I should know, I install these things all the time!&quot;<br>  &quot;Uh-huh.&quot; I sigh yet again, then have a minor brainstorm. &quot;OH,   Actually! What service pack is the CD you're using.&quot;<br>  &quot;Six.&quot;<br>  &quot;Ah, use Seven, it has the CD drivers built right into the CD.&quot;<br>  &quot;But how does that work?&quot;<br>  &quot;You've heard of data readahead?&quot;<br>  &quot;No?&quot;<br>  &quot;Well this is the same thing, it's an enhanced readahead which allows the   system to cache the driver for the CD.&quot;<br>  The glazed expression tells me all I need to know about the credibility of that   particular lie.<br>  &quot;DuhOK.&quot;<br>  &quot;Help yourself, they're in that silver package over there...&quot;<br>  One high-pitched scream later, a small battery powered inverter kit drops to   the floor. The Boss, ever on the alert for something to make his day pass quicker,   investigates.<br>  &quot;What's going on here?&quot; he asks ignoring the doubly glazed expression   on the consultant sitting in a courier basket.<br>  &quot;Oh he's just pleased because the latest enhancement to Solitaire arrived   today.&quot;<br>  &quot;YOU'VE GOT A BETTER SOLITAIRE!&quot; the boss gasps, his day peaking.<br>  &quot;Yeah, the install disks are in the shiny parcel on the floor - haven't   had a chance to..&quot;<br>  &gt;EEEEEEEEEEEEEE&lt;<br>  Ah, maybe it isn't such a bad day after all. <br>  </font></p><hr><hr><p align="center"><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>BOFH   '00. </strong></font></p><hr><p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <br>  BOFH wants to know: how dangerous are your users?<br>  By: Simon Travaglia<br>  Posted: 24/06/2000 at 09:23 GMT<br>  BOFH 2000 Episode 24 (Quiz no.3)Sure, they look about as likely to rebel as   the pack of mindless sheep that they are - but can they be trusted? </font></p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p><font size="3">Are your users reading forbidden literature?<br>  Are they trying to climb the technical greasy pole behind yourback?<br>  How will you know?<br>  Can the cattle prod be trusted to solicit the truth?</font></p><p><font size="3"><br>  It's time to put it to the test! <br>  Put yourself in your users' place and answer these simple questions to see if   things are going according to plan at YOUR workplace.<br>  1.

So where can the tape be?&quot; <br>  &quot;Probably hasn't been delivered,&quot; I say.<br>  &quot;Well it's funny because I saw the courier on the way out,&quot; he cries   triumphantly, producing a delivery receipt from his pocket. &quot;And he says   you DID get one.&quot; <br>  &quot;Yes&quot; the PFY jumps in, knowing my policy on signing for things only   too well &quot;- or rather someone named.. uh.. John Major did. Does HE work   here?&quot; <br>  &quot;The beancounters maybe?&quot; I suggest helpfully. <br>  &quot;It doesn't matter,&quot; The Boss cries yet again, with a hint of triumph   in his voice, while producing another tape. &quot;I got a copy delivered just   in case!&quot; <br>  He hands itover, chomping at the bit to get the tape read-in. <br>  &quot;Chop! Chop!&quot; he cries. &quot;What's on it?&quot; <br>  &quot;Well, as I've only just got the thing, it's hard to say,&quot; I respond,   not appreciating The Boss's attempts to grease the gears of media reading. <br>  &quot;Well it's really important!&quot; The Boss burbles, stating once more,   for the benefit of the COMPLETELY bloody stupid, the reason for his visit. <br>  &quot;Yes, yes,&quot; I murmur, slapping the tape into the external drive on   my machine. <br>  Normally - I have to admit - I'd only be reading a foreign tape once I'd run   it through the Virus Scanning Bulk-Eraser (Never had a Virus that's survived   a good, hard, scanning from that baby). HOWEVER, if I do that it's only going   to have The Boss skulking about for even longer. And I don't think I could handle   it. <br>  Once it's in, I run a quick tar, an od, and finally a binary dump to come to   an interesting conclusion. <br>  &quot;The tape's blank,&quot; I tell The Boss, ignoring his disbelieving facial   response. <br>  &quot;It can't be, it was written by a professional archiving company!&quot;   <br>  &quot;Then it must have been written in Braille.&quot; <br>  &quot;Or marker pen!&quot; the PFY cries, recalling a past habit of mine of   writing: &quot;The Boss is a Winker&quot; on the leader of 9 track tapes, to   give the tape monkey something to cheer him up at backup time. <br>  &quot;Well fast forward the tape along a bit, maybe the data starts further   on..&quot; The Boss cries, getting a little disconcerted. &quot;Perhaps they   didn't rewind it properly before they wrote it.&quot; <br>  &quot;Can't happen,&quot; I respond. &quot;All tapes have a beginning of tape   mark of someform. If there's nothing after that mark, there's nothing on the   tape.&quot; <br>  &quot;But.. But.. &quot; <br>  &quot;Look, I'll show you&quot; I cry, grabbing a recent addition from the rubbish   bin and yanking it's label off before The Boss can cop a dekko, &quot;Here's   a tape with, uh, intermittent read errors, which we chucked out.&quot; <br>  I slap the tape in the drive and run it up. <br>  &quot;Look, see, data!&quot; <br>  &quot;I see.&quot; <br>  &quot;Which starts at the beginning of the tape. All valid data. Actually, how   were you going to interpret your data?&quot; <br>  &quot;Oh, with this program,&quot; The Boss burbles, pulling a floppy out of   the Pandora's box that is his business suit. <br>  I chuck the floppy into my machine and run up the executable (without even virus   checking because I like to live on the edge) and pump the data at it. <br>  &quot;Well&quot; I cry, &quot;if we used the data on THIS tape for instance,   it says that... 68% of people prefer British Racing Green or Cobalt Blue, while   11% prefer reds and browns... 73% of people prefer a name that is orientated   to the British and/or American markets as opposed to Asian... 67% like chrome,   although 53% of those didn't like it to be a dominating influence... uh, 67%   of the respondents were in the upper quartile of income earners, and a staggering   83% say they buy our products recently.&quot; <br>  &quot;Well, that's believable as the survey was of our clients, and a lot of   them are rather well-to-do,&quot; The Boss says. <br>  &quot;Remember,&quot; I add, applying a pin to The Boss's bubble. &quot;this   is just a tape I pulled out of the bin. The results are just an interpretation   of the binary data.&quot; <br>  &quot;But it's so accurate - it's almost like it WAS the survey data!&quot;   he responds. <br>  &quot;Hmmm. And you're not suspicious?&quot; <br>  &quot;Suspicious? Why?&quot; <br>  &quot;Well if a survey confirms EVERYTHING you expected, why spend a large amount   of money on a survey? I certainly wouldn't like to be the person who suggested   an expensive survey like that when it comes out telling us what we already know...&quot;   <br>  The Boss is strangely quiet at this. <br>  &quot;No,&quot; I continue. &quot;What you want is a survey that breaks new   ground -tells us something we don't know. Similar data, but varying by certain   degrees.&quot; <br>  A 15-watt bulb suddenly illuminates in The Boss's mind. <br>  &quot;Have you got any data like the data on that tape?&quot; <br>  &quot;I don't know,&quot; I mumble, looking to the PFY for inspiration. &quot;What   was on that tape?&quot; <br>  &quot;Soft Core Porn,&quot; the PFY cries, obviously mistaking it for one of   our archive tapes. <br>  &quot;WHAT?!?&quot;<br>  &quot;We, uh, take copies of stuff we delete from the users' shares,&quot; I   ad lib,&quot;just in case they complain, then deny having it.&quot; <br>  &quot;Ah. So I want to use soft core porn as the input.&quot; <br>  &quot;NO!&quot; I cry. &quot;Soft core didn't work, the data was totally unbelievable.   You're going to have to use some DIFFERENT data. Hardcore porn is probably best&quot;   <br>  &quot;Hardcore?!&quot; he says anxiously. <br>  &quot;Yes,&quot; the PFY adds. &quot;Possibly even bestiality. IF you want good   data to cover your arse..&quot; <br>  . . . <br>  Two days later, at The Boss's leaving drinks (after the Big Porn scandal, which   was after the Big Survey scandal where The Boss presented the data that people   liked the idea of Purple and Yellow- embossed Chrome product, with names like   Kamakuza which would be bought en masse by low income types)... <br>  &quot;How on earth did they find out?&quot; The Boss cries.<br>  &quot;Well, I think the giveaway was when you attached the data file to your   email and didn't change the file extension from .jpg,&quot; I murmur. <br>  Sigh... <br>  Still, it was time for a change.... <br>  </font></p><hr><hr><p align="center"><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>BOFH   '00. </strong></font></p><hr><p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <br>  The Bastard gets taste of own medicine<br>  By: Simon Travaglia<br>  Posted: 12/07/2000 at 11:18 GMT<br>  This episode is based on real experiences with some of the largest computer   companies in the globe.

Twelve minutes of ringing later the   phone is answered. (I could learn something from these people.)<br>  &quot;Hello, Lifeline, what is your Client Reference Code?&quot;<br>  &quot;Uh, 2734278,&quot; I respond.<br>  &quot;No, that's your customer number, I need your client reference code,&quot;   she replies sternly.<br>  &quot;What would that look like?&quot; I ask, never having heard of it before.<br>  &quot;The Client Reference Code is a 17 letter alphanumeric identifier attached   to the top of all invoices,&quot; she replies.<br>  &quot;I'm afraid I don't have that with me at the moment, can I use my Customer   number?&quot; I ask politely.<br>  &quot;I'm sorry, my machine only accepts the Client Reference Code,&quot; she   responds.<br>  &quot;Right, call you back soon.&quot;<br>  I look thru the swathe of maintenance invoices to find that the client reference   code was only issued in the past 2 weeks and is to be used for all maintenance   calls. Excellent. I phone back.<br>  &quot;BBETA7873884A671F,&quot; I answer, in response to her answer, some 10   minutes later.<br>  &quot;I'm sorry, we don't have a record of PPECA7873884A671S,&quot; she responds.<br>  Of course not.<br>  &quot;Sorry, I'll repeat, BRAVO, BRAVO, ECHO, TANGO, ALPHA, 7873884, ALPHA,   671 FOXTROT.&quot;<br>  &quot;Ah,&quot; she replies with what I believe is a tinge of disappointment,   &quot;here we go. What was your PIN number?&quot;<br>  &quot;Pardon?&quot;<br>  &quot;Your PIN number for this Reference Code.&quot;<br>  &quot;0000,&quot; I guess.<br>  &quot;OK, she responds even more glumly. &quot;And what seems to be the problem?&quot;<br>  &quot;We have a hard disk failure.&quot;<br>  &quot;I see. What was the serial number of the hard disk?&quot;<br>  &quot;I'm afraid I can't tell you that because opening the case would void our   maintenance agreement,&quot; I respond, knowing only too well the odds are against   me.<br>  &quot;Uh-huh. And your contact number?&quot;<br>  I give her my direct number, which she duly takes down. I get her to repeat   it till she gets it correct - no fool me.<br>  &quot;Alright, I'll have an engineer call you within the next working week.&quot;<br>  &quot;Within four hours, I believe.&quot;<br>  &quot;Um... No, you're on Premium Cover, that's response within a working week.&quot;<br>  &quot;No, four hours.&quot;<br>  &quot;No, four hours is for Premium Direct Cover, You only have a Premium Contract.&quot;<br>  &quot;I see. Can I ask a question off the record?&quot;<br>  &quot;I suppose so.&quot;<br>  &quot;How many people get this far?&quot;<br>  &quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br>  &quot;As far as actually getting a technician to call them.&quot;<br>  &quot;Off the record?&quot;<br>  &quot;Yes.&quot;<br>  &quot;About Three per cent. Twenty per cent get put off by the difficulty of   IVR, another 10 per cent get lost in the IVR system and probably lose their   mind, 13 per cent or so don't know, and never find, their Client Reference number.   Eight per cent do, but don't know their pin, 25 per cent supply me an 'incorrect   contact number', and 18 per cent can't wait a week and upgrade to Premium Direct,   and three per cent go insane and get taken away.&quot;<br>  &quot;So do you have any engineers?&quot;<br>  &quot;Off the record?&quot;<br>  &quot;Uh-huh.&quot;<br>  &quot;One. He lives in Wales. We mostly use the Premium Direct money to get   you a service contract with another service network - one that gives us a discount   if we have less that three calls a year. Otherwise you have to wait for him   to get a discount train fare into London.&quot;<br>  &quot;And how many staff in your company?&quot;<br>  &quot;Apart from me and the engineer?&quot;<br>  &quot;Yes.&quot;<br>  &quot;None.&quot;<br>  &quot;I see.

I mean, &quot;customer&quot;.   What was I thinking? <br>  &quot;Cut-throat business, sales,&quot; I tell my man - George - info supplied   courtesy of the subscription sticker on the back of his mag. &quot;Now, what   can I help you with. You looking for computer then?&quot; <br>  &quot;Well not exactly,&quot; George says evasively - not wanting to commit   his soul - whilst nodding in the direction of a similarly aged woman, &quot;Alice   here would like to learn a bit about them and so we decided to buy one and I'll   teach her what I know.&quot; <br>  It's borderline, but I think Alice might JUST be up to the exciting two minutes   of typing terror as they switch on. <br>  &quot;Excellent. Well, I see you've been reading up on the subject. You definitely   don't want to rush into a purchase like this.&quot; <br>  &quot;No, no, I've been getting this book for a couple of years now, just biding   my time...&quot; George admits sagely. <br>  &quot;A good idea,&quot; I respond. &quot;Now, what did you think you wanted   to look at?&quot; <br>  &quot;A Pentium III 733 with 128 Megs of RAM, 18 gigabyte hard disk, Windows   2000, Microsoft Office, a 56K modem, a Colour Inkjet printed and an internal   ZIP drive&quot; he blurts out, reading from his copious handwritten notes.&quot;   <br>  &quot;A Pentium III. Really? Well, I SUPPOSE you know what you're doing.&quot;   <br>  &quot;What do you mean?&quot; <br>  &quot;Well you've read the Pentium IV is out.&quot; <br>  &quot;Yes.&quot; <br>  &quot;Well the price in Pentium IIIs is bound to plummet when the Pentium IV   is released - Specially,&quot; I look around furtively, &quot;... when the public   find out that it's actually Two Pentium IIs on top of each other.&quot; <br>  &quot;Really?&quot; <br>  &quot;Of course - that's what all those extra pins are!!&quot; <br>  &quot;But they're not releasing Pentium IVs yet!&quot; <br>  &quot;No, but you COULD set yourself up for an upgrade.&quot; <br>  &quot;How?&quot; <br>  Again I look around furtively before responding &quot;Well, You buy an upgradable   Pentium II, and then, when the Pentium IV is released, just solder another Pentium   II on top of the other processor. But it has to be an upgradable one..&quot;   <br>  &quot;Why don't I just buy one and upgrade it now then?&quot; <br>  &quot;It's not supported by the operating system yet!&quot; <br>  &quot;Oh, of course!&quot; <br>  &quot;Now the only other thing that concerns me is that you're not buying any   floppies for backup.&quot; <br>  &quot;Well no, I'm getting a Zip disk!&quot; <br>  &quot;They're good, of course - but often stolen with the machine. That's why   we recommend buying floppies.&quot; <br>  &quot;But to backup an 18 gigabyte disk I'd need...&quot; <br>  &quot;About 180 boxes of floppies, yes. Or 18 Zip disks. Now which would be   easier to steal?&quot; <br>  &quot;The Zip disks!&quot; George cries. <br>  &quot;Whereas the boxes of floppies would just slow the villains down.&quot;   <br>  &quot;I never thought of that.&quot; <br>  &quot;Most people never do. In fact,&quot; I add, again looking around. &quot;A   lot of salespeople try and talk you out of buying floppies..&quot; <br>  &quot;Why?&quot; <br>  &quot;Well, I'm not pointing the finger&quot; I respond &quot;But on the 'GUARANTEE   FORM' they get your Name and ADDRESS.&quot; <br>  &quot;You mean they ste..&quot; <br>  &quot;I never said that!&quot; I cry. &quot;But I NEVER put my real name or   address on one of those things.&quot; <br>  &quot;I see. Point Taken. But the rest of what I want is spot-on then.&quot;   <br>  &quot;Well, the 56K modem's a bit... well...&quot; <br>  &quot;What?&quot; <br>  &quot;Oh it probably won't matter to you of course, but, well, SOME modems have   porn detection circuits in them which ring Freephone numbers at night to tell   government agencies if you're a pervert.&quot; <br>  &quot;You're joking!&quot; <br>  &quot;I wish I was. It's been in place in modems ever since the 38K ones were   released.&quot; <br>  Round about now I'm starting to feel like a real bastard, but then I remember   his jibes. <br>  &quot;Did I say 38K?&quot; I cry, &quot;I meant 19K! But it never pays to take   chances - 9600 to be certain. The beauty of it all is that all this stuff is   dirt cheap now - PIIs, floppies, 9K modems..&quot; <br>  &quot;Well I'm certainly glad I spoke to you,&quot; George cries. &quot;Now,   how about you sell me it?!&quot; <br>  &quot;Actually, I'm a consultant and don't do sales, but I'll line someone up   for you,&quot; I cry helpfully. <br>  I break like the wind and get to Ahim. <br>  &quot;Hi, my friend here's a collector of older equipment and would really like   to pick up some equipment for a working model of the computing of the late 90s.   Could you help him out?&quot; <br>  Ahim has gone before I've finished the sentence and is already thinking of the   accolades he's going to be getting from his boss for offloading all the crap   that tourists don't even buy. <br>  As for me, my job here is done - I wait till the trolley load of legacy kit   is out the door before heading down to the Rising Sun for a celebratory lager.   <br>  Life is sweet, but revenge - more so. <br>  </font></p><hr><hr><p align="center"><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>BOFH   '00. </strong></font></p><hr><p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <br>  BOFH wants to know - would you make a good engineer?<br>  By: Simon Travaglia<br>  Posted: 25/07/2000 at 14:43 GMTSo you think you've got some idea of what hardware's   all about then?

Feeling magnanimous - and wanting the phone to stop ringing so I can   get back to sleep - I pick up the receiver..<br>  &quot;Hello, is this the Systems guys?&quot;<br>  &quot;It certainly is!&quot; I cry, full of the joyful spirit that denotes a   post-lunch computing professional.<br>  &quot;Um, OK, I'm configuring my new PC and it says I should write some stuff   down on the configuration card at the back of the book for my own records.&quot;<br>  &quot;You're WHAT?&quot;<br>  &quot;Configuring my new PC. My old one was really slow so The Boss said I could   use the one he was using at home if I reinstall it from scratch.&quot;<br>  &quot;Ahh - you shouldn't be doing that, a home machine might be virally infected.&quot;<br>  &quot;No no, it's fine I ran a virus scan across it just this morning.&quot;<br>  &quot;Which scan software did you use?&quot;<br>  &quot;I'm not sure, but it's one that I found on a Bulletin Board last year.&quot;<br>  &quot;I see. Okay then, that's probably OK - which machines were you going to   access with it?&quot;<br>  &quot;Just some of the desktops in my department - do you think that would be   OK?&quot;<br>  &quot;Hmm. Do you have write access to their Shares?&quot;<br>  &quot;Yes..&quot;<br>  &quot;Ah well that's fine then - shouldn't be a problem at all. Now, what&quot;   'stuff' do you need to know?&quot;<br>  &quot;It says I need to write down a MAC address?&quot;<br>  &quot;Hmmm. We usually use the nearest one, which is just around the corner.   I think the number's on the side of the building from memory. Just jot that   down and pick me up a couple of burgers and one of those ice cream desserts   while you're there.&quot;<br>  &quot;Duh-huh.&quot;<br>  &quot;What else did you need to know?&quot;<br>  &quot;It says: 'printer driver?'&quot;<br>  &quot;That's Dave, he's the new stores guy, but he delivers printers too.&quot;<br>  &quot;...OK, Dave. Next it says: 'Memory' and 'M.B.' - do I write down 128,   like what it says when it starts?&quot;<br>  &quot;No, write down 32.&quot;<br>  &quot;But the machine doesn't say that!&quot;<br>  &quot;Don't worry, I'm sure we'll have that corrected by morning...&quot;<br>  &quot;Oh, Ok. Great! Now it says my IP Address. What's my IP address?&quot;<br>  &quot;127.0.0.1 - you'll need to configure that into the TCP/IP setup of your   machine too. Then use the 'Ping' program to make sure that it's working.&quot;<br>  &quot;Subnet Mask?&quot;<br>  &quot;Ah, that would be 0.0.255.255 - what we call a B-Minus Subnet mask.&quot;<br>  &quot;Righto. Name Server Address?&quot;<br>  &quot;*NAME* Server address? How do they spell that in that manual?&quot; <br>  &quot;N-A-M-E.&quot;<br>  &quot;I think there's a spelling mistake then - it should be SAME server address.   The same 127 number you used before.&quot;<br>  &quot;Why do they want that?&quot;<br>  &quot;Oh, it's a typical computing ploy - They give you a lot of boxes to fill   in so that you think you're getting value for money. I've seen some supposed   manuals that ask for things like, oh, WINS server addresses and all sorts of   other mumbo jumbo!&quot;<br>  &quot;I've got that here!&quot;<br>  &quot;Oh dear, do they ask for a DNS suffix as well?&quot;<br>  &quot;YES!&quot;<br>  &quot;The Don't Need Service suffix - I mean who would say they didn't need   service?'<br>  &quot;So why's it there?&quot;<br>  &quot;Same as usual - if you put it in the Customer thinks they're getting better   value for money&quot;<br>  &quot;I can't believe people would do that!&quot;<br>  &quot;Happens all the time. Now, do you mind if I get some info off you for   the Helpdesk records - just helps us in future if you have any problems with   your Machines.&quot;<br>  &quot;Uh, OK.&quot;<br>  &quot;Office Number?&quot;<br>  &quot;302.&quot;<br>  &quot;Phone Extension - 4781 right?&quot;<br>  &quot;Yes.&quot;<br>  &quot;Name: Jim Forford?&quot;<br>  &quot;Yep.&quot;<br>  &quot;Network Port Number?&quot;<br>  &quot;Sorry?&quot;<br>  &quot;The number of the plug hole the blue network cable plugs into..&quot;<br>  &quot;Oh, ah... ah.. &gt;scrabble&lt; 302-R-1.&quot;<br>  &quot;No, that would be your BLACK Power Cable, we'll get to that later. For   now I'm after the BLUE cable. The Socket number has your room number and a U   in it&quot;<br>  &quot;Oh, Ok. 302-U-4&quot;<br>  &quot;Right. Access Swipe Card Number?&quot;<br>  &quot;Hang on, &gt;scrabble&lt; 301009&quot;<br>  &quot;Does it have an Issue Number under the Card Number?&quot;<br>  &quot;Yes, Issue 1.&quot;<br>  &quot;So you're new here?&quot;<br>  &quot;Yeah, just started two weeks ago.&quot;<br>  BINGO!<br>  &quot;Right - and lastly, your Bankcard pin number?&quot;<br>  &quot;What do you need that for?!?!&quot;<br>  &quot;Well just in case the High Coarsivity Magnetic Strip on your Bankcard   overwrites the Low Coarsivity Image on your swipe card, we need the PIN number   to pass to the security access control computer to let you into the building.&quot;<br>  ***DUMMY MODE ON***<br>  &quot;Oh, of course. 4732.&quot;<br>  &quot;Right. And now we just need the pin depth of the Power Socket your machine   is plugged into.&quot;<br>  &quot;Huh?&quot;<br>  &quot;Just need the depth of the holes on the socket 302-R-1. To make sure your   machine gets all the power it needs.&quot;<br>  &quot;How do I do that?&quot;<br>  &quot;Shove a paper clip in the earth hole and measure how deep it goes down.&quot;<br>  &quot;Isn't that dangerous?&quot;<br>  &quot;No, it's the earth.&quot;<br>  &quot;Oh, Ok. Uh..... &gt;scrabble&lt; &gt;scribble&lt; Ah, about 1/2 an inch.&quot;<br>  &quot;Right now measure the other two with another paperclip while keeping yourself   earthed with the first one.&quot;<br>  &quot;Ok, Uh &gt;scrabble&lt; uh just under 1/2 an inch... and &gt;scrZZZZZEEERRRRRT!&quot;<br>  Quick as a flash I'm onto the PFY who is, as luck would have it, sleeping in   the third floor Comms Room...<br>  &quot;Right, C.P.R PRACTICE, Room 302. Then ATM Withdrawal Practice, lucky number   4732.&quot;<br>  &quot;On my way!&quot; the PFY cries, dropping the phone in his haste.<br>  It's like a well-oiled post-lunchtime machine - Perfect.<br>  But for now, Morpheus calls. <br>  </font></p><hr><hr><p align="center"><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>BOFH   '00. </strong></font></p><hr><p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <br>  BOFH takes the Piss<br>  By: Simon Travaglia<br>  Posted: 19/08/2000 at 10:49 GMT<br>  BOFH2000: Episode 31<br>  So The Boss has volunteered my services to the Beancounters to upgrade some   software an PC-based unix system to its latest (and last, if there's a God)   revision - from the current version they have - which was probably installed   on the Ark.<br>  And as is always the case with vendors of old, dodgy software, there's more   clauses to the Warranty than there is Warranty (or Documentation), so it looks   like a suck-it-and-see job.<br>  I hate it.<br>  I offer to slap Linux in and rebuild their system for them, but apparently some   equally crap chunk of interface software absolutely HAS to have this EXACT flavour   of Unix to run, or it'll just sit mindlessly in the corner like most of its   users.<br>  Eventually I come across the licences for the software, which probably cost   more to print than the product is worth - and notice that the licences are for   the old version of the software, and not the new version they were delivered   with.<br>  Sigh.<br>  So I've got to choose whether to back the whole lot up on floppies using a brain-dead   version of the only backup package the system has - cpio - and then perform   the upgrade, or give it a miss altogether.<br>  So I'm packing up my kit when The Boss rolls in.<br>  &quot;So what's it look like?&quot; he asks, peering at the documentation and   pretending he can read multiple syllable words. &quot;Looks tricky..&quot;<br>  &quot;More than tricky&quot; I respond, &quot;A pig's breakfast - The licences   aren't valid and the documentation is shite!&quot;<br>  &quot;Nonsense, it's just a misprint!&quot; he cries when I show him the evidence.   &quot;It's bound to be a typing mistake!&quot;<br>  To top my day off, the user of the machine concerned arrives for his twopenn'th   of information.<br>  &quot;How's it going?&quot; he asks nervously.<br>  &quot;Fine!&quot; the boss cries, &quot;Just about to get started! Well, I'll   leave you to it!&quot;<br>  He trundles off with the user for a cup of something which I can only hope is   toxic..<br>  And I'm left wondering what Lassie would do... would she dial the suspiciously   short US 24hr freecall number? Would she ring the local &quot;Value Added&quot;   (pfft) Reseller and ask what the hell's going on? Or would she just relieve   herself on the cabinet and wander off?<br>  So I'm relieving myself on the cabinet (with the Power OFF, of course) when   the user returns to the office. ..<br>  Slightly shocked by the look of it.<br>  &quot;Thank goodness you're here!&quot; I cry, adlibbing like a daemon, &quot;Quick,   get a fire extinguisher - I think I'm holding it at bay!!!&quot;<br>  He rips out of the office like a madman while I escalate things a bit by kicking   the tower over and jumping on it a couple of times until the lid pops off, to   &quot;stifle any lingering flames&quot;.<br>  When he gets back I empty half a cylinder of dry powder into the floppy and   CD openings just to make sure that it doesn't &quot;spontaneously re-ignite&quot;.<br>  . . .<br>  &quot;Better safe that sorry!&quot; I mention to my helper as I empty the other   half of the cylinder into the cooling fan inlet of his machine's power supply.<br>  &quot;My system!&quot; he gasps. &quot;YEARS of work!&quot;<br>  &quot;Oh, don't worry about it, it's all backed up,&quot; I reassure him.<br>  &quot;Really?!&quot;<br>  &quot;Nah, couldn't be stuffed. But hey, they hard drive's still OK!&quot;<br>  &quot;You think so?&quot;<br>  &quot;Almost definitely - there it is there, hardly a scratch on it, except   for those heel marks.&quot;<br>  &quot;What heel marks?&quot;<br>  &gt;CRUNCH&lt; &gt;CRUNCH&lt; &gt;CRUNCH&lt;<br>  &quot;Those ones!&quot;<br>  . . .<br>  So I'm in The Boss's office and he's not buying the fire story for a minute.   Neither is he buying the: &quot;my dog ate the backup tape&quot; story.<br>  &quot;You're for the high jump now!&quot; he cries, grabbing the phone and punching   in security's number. &quot;You're as good as gone!&quot;<br>  &quot;Gone?!&quot; The PFY cries, arriving in the nick of time. &quot;That's   great! I can't believe my luck!&quot;<br>  &quot;?&quot; The Boss hmmms.<br>  &quot;Well *I* get to be in charge! I get to make decisions for myself!

Another NMI brings him back to the real world..<br>  &quot;Well, maybe I was a bit hasty in my initial estimation,&quot; The Boss   adds nervously, thinking carefully about the devil he knows.<br>  &quot;No, no!&quot; I cry, realising the vast untapped fear potential stored   within the PFY, &quot;I think you were more than justified! I'm a walking technical   timebomb! I'm a menace to myself and others. I can't be trusted near equipment!   Like your monitor.&quot;<br>  &quot;My monitor?&quot;<br>  &gt;CRASH&lt;<br>  &quot;Yes!&quot;<br>  &quot;An accident,&quot; The Boss cries, &quot;could have happened to anyone!   Look!

It's all rather fun really.<br>  Even more fun when security rocket up in response to the sounds of crashing   on the phone call they just received in time to see the boss &quot;accidentally&quot;   push his bookshelf over.<br>  &quot;Thank Goodness you're here!&quot; I cry, using a line that's served me   well in the recent past. &quot;He's gone completely mad you know.

First off, I suppose you want to look over the kit we   have about the place.&quot; <br>  &quot;Hi, I'm Dave - Uh, I actually saw the computer suite during my interview   - with the, uh, Head of I.T.&quot; <br>  &quot;The other Brian?&quot; respond, covering well. &quot;Yes, a bit confusing   I suppose. Still, you'll be dealing with me from now on, after.. well, you know.&quot;   <br>  &quot;Well actually I don..&quot; <br>  &quot;Yes, a bit of a tragedy, but then again, we knew it was on the cards when   we found that hole in the microwave dish shielding. They tell us they've repaired   it though, so I'm sure you've nothing to worry about. Anyway, I'd best show   you around to give them a chance to pack up his stuff before you move in. Had   a CT scan recently have you?&quot; <br>  &quot;No, why?&quot; Dave asks nervously.<br>  &quot;Oh, no reason!&quot; I respond.&quot;But probably best to sit on the LEFT   hand side of the room till we're sure.&quot; <br>  &quot;The left hand side as you're looking in or out?&quot; he asks. <br>  &quot;Yes, that's right. Now you've no experience of computing till now?&quot;   <br>  &quot;No, I was in the armed forces, but decided to break into Computing when   my 20 years were up.&quot; <br>  &quot;But surely you've used computers there?&quot; <br>  &quot;No our work revolved around troop movements, armoury inventories, that   sort of thing, but I'm sure I'll get the hang of it. How hard can it be? We'll   have you running like clockwork in no time.&quot; <br>  So it's decided then... <br>  &quot;Did HR Issue you with an Access ID card?&quot; I ask, as we enter mission   control.<br>  &quot;Yes.&quot; <br>  &quot;Right, I'll just get one of the Systems and Networks guys to validate   that..&quot; <br>  The PFY rolls over with the bulk eraser, and a short &gt;BZZZZZeeerrrt&lt; later   Dave's building access is severely curtailed... <br>  &quot;Right, we need to get you to your office. Right this way...&quot; <br>  I walk Dave down to Brian's office - the plausibility of my story going up as   the bin appears to have been used to store the 'overflow' of the food which   upset him so much yesterday.<br>  &quot;Oh dear,&quot; I sigh. &quot;They haven't got round to packing up his   things. Actually, perhaps you could help? Just chuck all the personal stuff   in a box.&quot;<br>  &quot;B.b.but isn't this YOUR office?&quot; He asks.<br>  &quot;Ah, not any more. They decided I should work down the corridor, you know,   after everything. So if you could just pack up that stuff and remember to stay   away from the left wall..&quot; <br>  &quot;Stay AWAY from the lef..&quot; Dave mumbles as I close the door. <br>  &quot;Doing some tidying for Brian,&quot; I tell the secretary as I wander past   to mission control tapping my temple. &quot;Obsessive about it apparently..&quot;   <br>  The PFY and I have a 10-minute microwave laugh break, I outline my plan then   head back for round two. <br>  Dave's sitting in the dead center of the room, unable to decide which is left   and what proximity he should have to it.. <br>  &quot;Right well, I suppose we'd better get your manager's pack from the secretary,   with your business cards, signing authority and company credit card...&quot;   <br>  &quot;Ok&quot; Dave accedes, happy to be leaving the danger zone.<br>  &quot;So I guess you've never ordered supplies online before..?&quot; <br>  &quot;Never..&quot; <br>  &quot;That's a piece of luck, as I'm in a position to step you through the process.&quot;   <br>  Two hours and several large Internet purchases later Dave leaves the office   with a bit of a sweat on, from what he believes to be microwaves. I make sure   that the secretary gets a couple of glimpses of him wearing an aluminium foil   &quot;earthing hat&quot; before filling him in on some of the background of   computing.. <br>  &quot;..and that's why they call it rebooting..&quot; I explain, pointing Dave   in the direction of the stairwell and slipping him a pair of steel-caps. &quot;So   if you could just give us a hand and sort out the 4th floor machines, I've got   a fire alarm to test.&quot; <br>  &quot;Always willing to muck in!&quot; Dave cries obligingly, rising to the   challenge in a shot rather than return to his office. . . <br>  Later that day I explain the whole sordid thing to security - How Dave - who   wasn't all that stable to start with (confirmed by the secretary) had had a   Shell-Shocklike flashback to a war Nam, Korea or some other disastrous war zone   like Leeds and had gone on a machine- wrecking rampage through the building.   <br>  &quot;I'm surprised someone like that can even GET a gun licence,&quot; the   PFY comments, ensuring that Dave's next working day will be eventful. <br>  Almost makes me wish I hadn't told him it was virus combat costume party day   tomorrow.

I bought a brazing kit yesterday.&quot;<br>  Once again The Boss chooses to ignore a confession in favour of pursuing some   other line of enquiry.<br>  &quot;And here - apparently you assaulted a user?!?!&quot;<br>  &quot;Water under the bridge. A simple mistake that anyone could make.. We were   configuring his network and I gave him the choice of colour-coded cables, and   I misheard him saying that he wanted the violet option. I thought he said VIOLENT   connection option.&quot;<br>  &quot;Who on earth has a violent connection option?!&quot;<br>  &quot;We do. Now.&quot;<br>  &quot;But who would ask for it?&quot;<br>  &quot;Well, only one person so far...&quot;<br>  From then on it just goes downhill, and I'm forced to retire to my office well   chastised.<br>  &quot;Should I go and see if I can defuse the situation?&quot; The PFY asks,   fingering the government-disapproved cattle prod he just ordered as an 'Uninterruptible   Power Supply'.<br>  &quot;Oh, I shouldn't bother just at the moment.&quot;<br>  &quot;What, given up the good fight?&quot; The PFY asks disgustedly.<br>  &quot;No, someone brazed his door handles solid yesterday and epoxy- resined   his windows shut.&quot;<br>  &quot;Bastards!&quot; the PFY cries<br>  &quot;Yes.

And every company has one - the person who doesn't   really have a job outside of collecting stats on how winnable the Solitaire   game on their desktop is. But so as to disguise this fact, they spend most of   their time out of their office &quot;working&quot; with others. <br>  &quot;Morning,&quot; he burbles, unaware that his presence is about as welcome   as Bill Gates at a Linux users' beerfest. &quot;What're you doing?&quot;<br>  &quot;Ah, just debugging an application,&quot; I respond, trying to maintain   my train of thought.<br>  &quot;Oh yes, I used to do a bit of programming in my earlier days,&quot; he   meanders, no doubt recalling the cutting edge of technical pressure of remembering   to press return at the end of the line.<br>  Now call me a pedant, call me ELITIST even, but if there's ONE THING that *REALLY*   gets on my TITS, it's someone claiming to be a &quot;programmer&quot; because   they had to type a PIN number in every day to operate a cash register, enter   word processing documents or generally confuse the crap out of themselves<br>  &quot;We used to use the old black boxes.&quot; he continues, unaware of the   &quot;Did you ever use one of them? Tricky pieces of machinery, those, not like   these days with all the help screens and things you have to make it easier.   All we had back then was the F keys, and they weren't much help. No, you'd have   to nut out problems yourself!...&quot;<br>  He meanders aimlessly and I start wondering how long it's going to take to get   to the great Tab-key crisis of '83, and, more importantly, how full the skip   at the building site down the street is, and if someone would notice a heavy   6ft computer cabinet in it..<br>  &quot;...The number of times I had to resort to F2-ing the document - can't   recall what it used to do now, but it was a last resort that we had to use from   time to time. Look - tell you what - do you want me to give you a hand, I was   a bit of a dab hand with computers once, programmed quite a bit of stuff in   the editor - all sorts of stuff!&quot;<br>  &quot;OK,&quot; I respond, wondering if he'll leave me alone when he finds how   out of his depth he is.. &quot;What do you know about Perl?&quot;<br>  &quot;Pearls, Uh, that would be the, uh, 30th anniversary,&quot; he burbles   proudly.<br>  &quot;No,Perl, the scripting language,&quot; I say, through slightly clenched   teeth.<br>  &quot;Is it like vi?&quot; he replies, &quot;I programmed in vi a couple of   times - not a buff, mind, just a talented amateur, if I say so myself!&quot;<br>  Nggg.....<br>  My mind is now blanker than a blank thing, and welcomes the interruption afforded   by the sight of The PFY at the door. He, and my last hope, disappear quicker   than alcohol at a press release, JUST before the cruiser can catch sight of   him and regale him with stories of how he was an assistant once and how Philips   head screwdrivers are a lot easier to use these days, what with posidrive and   all.<br>  The Bastard! <br>  &quot;Well it's not MUCH like vi - but what I'm trying to do is find out why   an array appears to be overflowing on what SHOULD be a trivial amount of input,   when I'm only selecting the first couple of fields from a varying length input   string which is never null&quot;<br>  &quot;Uh..&quot;<br>  I'm faily sure he was with me up to 'array', though it can't hurt to put the   slipper in a couple more times..<br>  &quot;So did you get that on your vi encounters?&quot;<br>  &quot;Uh..&quot;<br>  &quot;Or was your work more of a scalar nature?&quot;<br>  &quot;Well as I said, I'd done more in the way of programming on the Black Boxes   we used in the old building - I tell you, sometimes you almost didn't know WHICH   button to push!&quot;<br>  I realise the futility of the Dummy Mode plan - he *LIVES* there so he's immune   to its effects. Which leaves the backup reserve plan..<br>  &quot;I can imagine!&quot; I concur, &quot;Actually, I think I know what the   problem is - it'll be the 3rd array desynchronisation counter.

I slip a wedge under the door before any more   cable can slop out the gap while I go to find The Boss. <br>  &quot;What&quot; I ask him, when he's wheezed his way downstairs, &quot;the   *HELL*, isTHAT?&quot; <br>  &quot;That's a COMMS room!&quot; he blurts, topping his previous personal best   effort by reading the label off the door without sticking his tongue out. <br>  I open a door to reveal the horror of the room within. A rat's nest of cabling,   thinwire, thickwire, UTP, some stuff that could be unshielded serial, and -   oh dear - what looks to be a token ring experiment... <br>  &quot;Obviously a little tidying is needed..&quot; The Boss admits grudgingly.   <br>  &quot;A little?&quot; <br>  &quot;Well, not so much as to cause an outage or anything, but perhaps you could,   uh, repatch them, a few at a time.&quot; <br>  A few minutes and one &quot;Facts of Life&quot; briefing later, The Boss is   informed about of the infinitesimal chances of fixing this without a major outage.   <br>  &quot;I see. So it would be an overnight process then?&quot; <br>  &quot;Overnight would be how long it would take just to get the cables out of   the hardware - if we used a gangmower and an axe. Outside of that, it's anybody's   guess as to what's in there and what it's connected to.&quot; <br>  &quot;So what do you suggest?&quot; <br>  &quot;Someone's going to have to go in there and fix it.&quot; <br>  &quot;Someone?&quot; <br>  &quot;Someone with networking knowledge...&quot; <br>  The PFY starts beating a surreptitious retreat. <br>  &quot;.. A bit younger and more agile than me..&quot; <br>  The PFY accelerates somewhat.. <br>  &quot;..someone who could get lost for days without anyone knowing or caring!&quot;   <br>  &quot;A CONTRACTOR!&quot; The Boss and PFY cry in unison, both happy that they   don&#8217;t meet the exacting criteria.. <br>  &quot;Yes, and what better contractor than someone who KNOWS about the cabling   firsthand, someone who perhaps, PUT it there in the first place,&quot; I cry,   fingering a self-promotional label on the back of the door. <br>  &quot;THE ORIGINAL CONTRACTOR!&quot; The boss cries, enlightened. <br>  BINGO!<br>  . . . ONE DAY LATER . .<br>  It's been a several of hours since the cabling contractor went in - after some   bad-mouthing of 'The current IT unprofessionals' to The Boss when he thinks   he's out of our earshot. Still, after he'd extorted a hefty hourly rate from   the boss, he was more than happy to sign on for the job. <br>  &quot;Poor bastard,&quot; The PFY mumbles quietly, shaking his head, proving   once and for all that he bears no grudges against people who disparage his good   name. <br>  &quot;But not so poor that you didn't wedge the door shut again once he was   in...&quot; <br>  &quot;I was worried about.. uh.. loss of.. uh.. aircooling in the riser..&quot;   he adlibs. <br>  &quot;We don't HAVE cooling in the riser..&quot; <br>  &quot;Oh. Oh well.&quot; <br>  . . . <br>  In the end we open the door in response to the complaints about a &quot;loss   of Internet&quot; and discover that the poor sod's in a bit of a state. <br>  &quot;Which of you bastards turned off the lights?&quot; he cries, a bit on   the hysterical side <br>  &quot;Are you sure it wasn't a breaker tripping? - it happens all the time in   this building!&quot; The PFY suggests helpfully. &quot;Apparently you installed   budget electrical cabling too..&quot; <br>  &quot;Oh yes and it just SO HAPPENED that the handle on the inside of the door   is missing AND a box of thinwire connectors just HAPPENED to fall down the comms   riser..&quot; <br>  &quot;That's where they got to!&quot; The PFY responds. &quot;I was looking   for those - couldn't find them anywhere! Course, it was dark with the lights   not working in the riser, so maybe I accidentally knocked them down the cable   gap..&quot; <br>  &quot;..Then I tripped on the floor ventilation grill which wasn't secured properly!&quot;   our contractor continues. <br>  &quot;And my, you have made a bit of a mess!&quot; <br>  &quot;It was a mess when I started!&quot; <br>  &quot;Yes, but it was a WORKING mess. In fact, that's why the company always   puts penalty clauses into its standard contracts - to recover lost income, etc,   in an outage situation like this. I hate to think what this must be costing   you!&quot; <br>  &quot;But this has nothing to do with me!&quot; <br>  &quot;The cables pulled themselves out of the patch panels and switch gear?&quot;   <br>  &quot;Y-No, but it wasn't my fault!&quot; <br>  &quot;Of course it wasn't. It wasn't like you installed all the cables in the   first place, charged a hefty premium on the top by selecting the longest cable   length possible, didn't document your work, didn't label any of the gear, provided   no strain relief, AND cut corners on the electrical cabling spec and circuit   breakers. I'm sure the court will find in your favour.&quot; <br>  &quot;COURT!?!&quot; <br>  &quot;Well, these things usually end up there after an outage of this magnitude.   And the repatching's will probably take you days to complete, which'll mean   even more mo..&quot; <br>  &quot;Well what can I do?&quot; <br>  &quot;Well, I s&#8217;pose you could hire a couple of contractors with intimate   knowledge of the network structure to give you a hand... But then again at such   short notice it's probably going to be expensive....&quot; <br>  &quot;I'll pay!!!&quot; <br>  &quot;Well, I think we can help you out. Course we'll need someone to feed all   the broken fibre up from the sub-basement spool for resplicing..&quot; <br>  So it's decided, he'll give us a hand. No sooner has he signed a large cheque   than we promise to say it was a routine outage and he's installed in the sub-basement   comms room with the fibre loom. <br>  While The PFY's placing the wedge and flicking the lights breaker, I'm popping   up a couple of stories with five boxes of thinwire terminators. <br>  Just like clockwork. <br>  </font></p><hr><hr><p align="center"><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>BOFH   '00. </strong>Just when you thought BOFH had disappeared...</font></p><hr><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>It's been a while and rumours are that you're losing your edge!

Right!&quot; <br>The PFY and I wait for all the news that must *BE* important enough to require a mobile conversation to bring it to us as soon as possible. <br>&quot;That virus is out again!&quot; he cries. <br>&quot;Which one?&quot; <br>&quot;That love one - Apparently you had it here a while ago - under a previous manager,&quot; he recounts smugly.<br>&quot;Ah yes, the one who invoked mailed the message to everyone in your address book, if you were stupid enough to open it, stupid enough to use Outlook, stupid enough not to have virus scanning installed and up to date...&quot; <br>&quot;Can there BE anyone that stupid?&quot; The Boss asks, chuckling away from what he believes is the technical highground. <br>&quot;Bill Gates makes a fortune out of them!&quot; the PFY slips in.<br>&quot;Does he make viruses too, then?&quot; <br>Which comes to the crux of the matter. The only thing WORSE than a technical boss is one who non-technical boss who believes that intellect and experience are obtained at the very same time as a job title - i.e. because he's become IT manager he can now manage IT.... Hence the headset. Hence the top-of-the-line brand spanking new desktop and laptop he demanded as befits and IT Professional. Complete with external consultant-installed virus protection. Hence the smug attitude. <br>Sigh. <br>&quot;Not exactly. Anyway, we're running interception mail delivery software, so we're relatively safe from that particular virus and it's many variants now&quot; I respond, &gt;BRAINWAVE!&lt; &quot;... But what we're a bit flummoxed about what to do about all this porn getting mailed into the company en masse.&quot; <br>His mental antennae extend faster and further than his headpiece antenna and he's over like a shot. So fast it almost looks like he's discovered the secret of teleportation. But still in a &quot;casual&quot; manner. Being an IT professional, he's interested in the problem, not the porn. <br>&quot;PORN, you say?&quot; <br>&quot;Yeah, Gobs of it!&quot; I cry &quot;- And I think 'gobs' is an appropriate term. I'm just about to delete it and warn the user concerned. And half his department's also signed up for it by the looks of their fileshare!&quot; <br>&quot;Hadn't you better keep some... evidence?&quot; The Boss cries, thinking on his feet whilst trying desperately to suppress his drool reflex (Who says he can't multitask?) &quot;Just in case they deny it?!&quot; <br>Hook line and sinker.. <br>&quot;Nah, it takes up too much space and we have nowhere to store it. Look, there's gigs of it!&quot; <br>I show him a fileshare cram packed with a couple of hundred megs of smut, and flash up a couple of images as a teaser. <br>&quot;He's even got them categorised!&quot; The PFY cries. <br>&quot;He has too!&quot; The Boss adds, surprised at the speed at which The PFY reached his conclusion. <br>(Given that it's The PFY's porn archive we're looking at, the feelings of surprise aren't mutual, though.) <br>&quot;Anyway, it's best we delete them to free up space on the server,&quot; I continue, making to drag the contents into the Recycle Bin. <br>&quot;I DO think you should retain proof. What if there's some legitimate work stashed in their somewhere? What if they deny it and claim it wasn't there or wasn't them.&quot;<br>&quot;I see what you mean. But we don't really have the space on the server, as you can see..&quot; <br>&quot;Ah. True. I know, what about my machine - I've got an 18gig disk with a PIII 866!&quot; he cries, spurting out his machine specs (obviously a party favourite) like a machine gun, &quot;and 256 meg of RAM!&quot; <br>(If only that were the case - after the great hardware robbery of last week... Patching the BIOS to report false info, however, took more time that ripping off the processor and memory, but it was time well spent...) <br>&quot;Well, I supposed we could store it there for a while...&quot;, I agree &quot;..just in case anyone asks.&quot; <br>.. Two days later.. <br>&quot;The Boss is pulling some long nights,&quot; the PFY comments a couple of days later as we exit a pub under the influence of hops derivative and notice a dull glow exiting his blinds into the street. <br>&quot;Yes, he's a driven man!&quot; I concur. &quot;Not everyone would 'categorise evidence' so thoroughly..&quot; <br>&quot;You'd think he'd go home at night, though..&quot; <br>&quot;Or at least wash and change his clothes...&quot; <br>.. Another two days later.. <br>&quot;And when they opened his office door the found him stark na...&quot; Sharon the secretary blurts to her mate in the break room, on what looks like a secondhand spanking new Madonna digital phone headset, stopping mid sentence as I enter the office to get my snail mail. <br>..which explains the &quot;Sealed by Security&quot; sticker over The Boss's door lock... <br>&quot;Can I help you?&quot; Sharon asks in a surly manner, not at all happy at being interrupted mid-gossip. <br>&quot;Yes, I was wondering if you could check out some clanking in the hold and let buildings maintenance know if something needs fixing.&quot; <br>&quot;Why don't you check it?&quot; <br>&quot;Because you've got the only Master Key - but if you want to loan it to me..&quot; <br>&quot;NO-ONE gets the Master Key!&quot; she cries, defending her realm. &quot;So I spose I'll go when I have some free time. Where's the hold then?&quot; <br>&quot;Well you know where the waste outflow pipe in the basement is?&quot; <br>&quot;No?&quot; <br>&quot;I'll draw you a map then...&quot; <br></font><hr><hr><p align="center"><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>BOFH   '00. </strong>BOFH Takes the Wind out of Sales</font></p><hr><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>&quot;So what you're basically saying is that your hardware is the most reliable stuff we're ever likely to buy, and all your competitors' stuff is built by intellectually-handicapped child labour in the Third World from parts that were discarded from your factory for being unreliable?&quot; The PFY slurs.<br>&quot;Yes,&quot; our host and vendor slurs back, gesturing wildly at the promotional material with his glass and leaving a semicircle of lager on the floor in it's wake. &quot;We produce the best stuff!&quot;<br>I love vendor Christmas parties - the way they cut through the crap and get to the truth of the matter.<br>&quot;Fair enough!&quot; the PFY cries. &quot;In that case we should cancel yesterday's order and get it straight into you as soon as possible.&quot;<br>&quot;Sooner, if possible,&quot; our salesman responds, seemingly still in a position to reap the benefits of a pre-Christmas bonus opportunity.<br>&quot;Well if you had a form I spose I could fill in the blanks and get the boss to sign it,&quot; the PFY responds, not too far gone to crash our alcohol gravy train.<br>&quot;I'll just go print one!&quot; the salesman slurs, stumbling in the direction of his office.<br>Seeing a vacant customer with several drinks under his belt, another sales vulture #2 swoops immediately, obviously not wanting to miss the opportunity of a sales theft.<br>&quot;Where's John gone?&quot; he asks, faking concern like a trooper.<br>&quot;Ah, he said he wasn't feeling too well. I'd just asked if he wanted another round,&quot; I respond, waving my almost empty pint around. &quot;We were looking at buy some ki..&quot;<br>&quot;I'll get you - both - a drink,&quot; he cries.<br>&quot;Great. Mine's a lager, with a Tequila Wallbanger chaser if they have one.&quot;<br>&quot;Me too,&quot; The PFY adds.<br>Exit Salesperson number Two..<br>&quot;Tequila Wallbanger?&quot;<br>&quot;Yeah, They'll wonder if we want a Tequila Sunrise or a Harvey Wallbanger and end up getting us both.&quot;<br>&quot;I don't think I can manage either of them!&quot;<br>&quot;Oh I'm not going to drink them - it just buys us a little time.&quot;<br>&quot;Time? For what?&quot;<br>&quot;Hi, I'm Dave, Sales Director for Large Business. I don't think we've met!&quot;<br>[Enter Vulture #3]<br>The PFY latches onto my plan as the Sales Director goes to check out the food's going and grab a couple of Lagers and Scotch and Tonic...and another Vulture drops in from on high.<br>&quot;Some form of competition?&quot; he murmurs.<br>&quot;Yes, I think there's some sort of bonus riding on the party..&quot;<br>#4 wanders off to get the Fan Speed specs for that floor full of machines we're thinking about buying - to make sure that their combined output isn't going to upset the climate control system in our building. (Okay, so I'm starting to clutch at straws.)<br>&quot;Here we go,&quot; Vulture #1 drools, returning with a sheaf of papers, &quot;All you need do is full in the number of machines, sign on the dotted line, and we're sorted!&quot;<br>&quot;Excellent!&quot; The PFY blurts. &quot;B-but where are the Infra Red Mice? And the ergonomic keyboards?&quot;<br>&quot;Be right back,&quot; he mumbles, heading back out the door at warp factor 0.003 after a nasty encounter with the door frame, half a foot to the left of where his eyes told him it was.<br>#3 is back next, with Lager and G&amp;Ts, obviously making a director- level decision about what we wanted - probably after seeing a poacher on the grounds.. He departs to get further info on the menu once we assure him that #1 was only showing us the start of the novel he's working on about a Microsoft Executive and a couple of showgirls.<br>#2 and #3 jostle a bit as #2 returns with the three drinks apiece I predicted. <br>&quot;So have you thought any more about the kit you were looking for?&quot; he blurts, not wanting to appear too eager, whipping out a catalogue just as #4 returns with the wind thrust ration of the cooling devices in question...<br>. . .<br>&quot;You started a fight between salespeople with our Major Supplier!&quot; the boss gasps incredulously. &quot;A fight which ended in a Sales Director being taken to hospital with bruises over 40 per cent of his body!!!!&quot;<br>&quot;That wasn't us!&quot; The PFY replies quickly. &quot;Once he went down half the place put the slipper in. Apparently he wasn't liked much, especially by the majority of women in the place.&quot;<br>&quot;You realise their sales force is decimated by the suspensions? That they're probably going to lose tens of thousands of pounds in sales?&quot;<br>&quot;Yes, I suppose so.&quot; I admit grudgingly, waiting for the inevitable...<br>BLOODY BRILLIANT!&quot; The Boss cries, breaking out a bottle of brandy hitherto hidden in the expansion slot area of his machine.<br>Sneaky Bastard.<br>&quot;You can't PAY for that sort of job satisfaction!&quot; he continues, filling a couple of tumblers happily and sharing them about with a large portion of Christmas cheer. <br>&quot;Some form of grudge?&quot;<br>&quot;Yeah, used to work for them. Changed my Large Business sale area to Bristol, then dropped me for non-performance. Now tell me, did you order anything?&quot;<br>&quot;We sort of felt obliged to get a couple of desktops after everything that happened. I suppose you'll want to cancel them because of our lack of purchase approval.&quot;<br>&quot;Certainly Not! Now tell me, did you get Standard Terms?&quot;<br>&quot;I suppose so,&quot; I respond, digging out our copy of the order.<br>&quot;Excellent - Guaranteed 10 working days delivery! We'll pursue that legally next year when they don't deliver.&quot;<br>&quot;How do you know they won't deliver?&quot;<br>&quot;Oh, it's practice to hold all orders of suspended staff till they can be confirmed with the client. So remember, no answering the phone now. But one thing, were you two responsible for any of the bruises on my former boss?&quot;<br>&quot;Well, one or two,&quot; The PFY ventures.<br>&quot;Well, he did try and sell us some refurbished P-II 300s as top line kit,&quot; I add.<br>&quot;One or two, you say?&quot;<br>&quot;Each.&quot;<br>&quot;Excellent! Another Brandy?&quot;<br>So it's true what they say about Xmas bringing staff and management closer together... <br></font><hr><p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font></p>
